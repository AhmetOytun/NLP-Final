["The zenith of the MCU franchise.I feel like I'm wasting my time writing down my thoughts about Avengers: Endgame, because nothing I (or any critic) could say about it would ever dissuade a prospective viewer from seeing it. But after having had the chance to watch it at a preview screening, I can't help but say a few spoiler-free words.\n\nI'm not your average fanboy -- most long-running franchises have bored me at this point, and I couldn't care less about the newest Star Wars episode or whether there will be another film set in the Harry Potter universe.\n\nBut Marvel films have been consistently watchable, with many solid entries and a few great ones (Winter Soldier, Ragnarok, the first Guardians of the Galaxy among others). And after Infinity War ended with a cliffhanger, I was looking forward to the conclusion. Boy, was I not disappointed!\n\nVery few highly-anticipated movies live up to the hype, but Avengers: Endgame is one of them. It's the perfect follow up to Infinity War, and the absolute zenith of the Marvel franchise. It's hard to see how they'll be able to top this one.\n\nIt's surprisingly inventive (even when you know where the story is headed, the plot takes a few tangents getting there), emotionally engaging (a few people were crying in the theater) and surprisingly funny (this is probably the most I've laughed in a Marvel film since Thor: Ragnarok). Visually speaking, it's a true spectacle (topping Infinity War in the 'epic battle' stakes), and even though it's three hours long, it doesn't feel bloated. The only times I glanced at my watch was because I was hoping there would be more time before the end.\n\nYes, it's a superhero movie, but an immensely entertaining one (especially for fans who have seen all the pictures that came before it: there are tons of references and inside jokes to reward the faithful).\n\nIf \"Return of the King\" managed to win Best picture at the 2003 Oscars Avengers: Endgame deserves at least a nomination. It's as good (and in many ways better) a conclusion to a fantasy/genre series as the Peter Jackson film,.\n\nGo see it.", "Very disappointingRight in the beginning, you know how the movie is going to end...the good guys are going to win. How anti-climactic that was.. The stage is not set right (half of all humanity is gone, but the enormity of that is not explored...)...when you have Thanos give his explanation as to why he did what he did, I found myself thinking - well, he actually has a point. In the meanwhile, every single superhero is given time to fight, say some cute things, some say a few smart things, a few even manage to say profoundly philosophical statements... The quantum physics explanations used to explain how things are done, are plainly non sense... ..they just made stuff up as they went on. Alls well that ends well. Except we spent 3 hours to find that out.", "Really disappointed...The dumbing down of Hulk and ruining his character by turning him into an utter wimp, turning Thor into a bumbling drunkard, really? Well done Disney on ruining yet another couple of hero's characters (See Luke Skywalker and Yoda in Disney's Last Jedi for extra confirmation of this) That's all I've got to say about this movie.", "A must watchgreat performances\nincredible visuals\nstory ends in a way to set worth a new generation of marvel stories/characters\nperfect send off for the original actors\na must see for any marvel or superhero fan", "A great ending to a wonderful 10 years saga.Endgame is certainly one of its kind. A movie that will be marked as the film of this decade. Building up from Iron Man to Captain Marvel, a 10 journey filled with joy, adventure and tears. And we need a perfect ending to all of that. Endgame is the perfect ending. A movie that has everything a fan will ever dream of, an amazing cast and a wonderful climax. It is such a huge payoff from 10 years worth of building up. To look at this from a Fan's perspective, it is an awesome movie and it is a masterpiece. But to look at this from a critic's perspective, it is not the best movie. It certainly lacks some elements to a perfect movie. But this to me, is such a wonderful movie and I definitely loved it. It has everything I wanted and I'm gonna give this movie a 9/10.", "End game without a proper endingThere are so many ways that the movie could have gone. But it is chosen to be this way. So the climax should not be criticised. The story is completed with no proper explanation for the rest of the avengers. Other avengers are not given importance in most of the places. Don't go to the movie if you know the spoilers. My experience has been spoiled by my friends.", "Meandering badly pace and mediocre movieThe first 50 minutes set up the movie very well but the second act lacks urgency and focus. The movie comes to a halt and feels as if it's meandering between scenes, not knowing what to do and not being very entertaining. The movie is also highly predictable and somewhat ruins Thanos's character due to a strange character decision. Iron man is given a lot to work with, which is compelling, same with Hawkeye. The ending is somewhat satisfying but also cringe. Overall it is a fine movie, not offensively bad but certainly not as good as it's predecessor.", "A MasterpieceWow there are so many troll reviews by inarticulate rubes who can't even explain their opinions.\n\nPeople are entitled to their own tastes, and the super hero genre of the Marvel variety that is a pastiche of action/adventure, sci-fi, and fantasy doesn't appeal to everyone, but for what it is, for what it succeeds at being for its target audience, Avengers: Endgame is currently the benchmark as a satisfying grand finale in a cinematic universe.\n\nThere can be no doubt that Infinity War and Endgame are masterpieces. That doesn't mean they're the best movies ever made, or that they're better than other masterpieces of different genres, it just means that it succeeds in every element required of it.\n\nThe barrier of entry to The Avengers, especially the last two films, is quite high and requires someone to watch a lot of movies, and without an investment in those characters in the Marvel film that lead up to Infinity War and Endgame, a casual viewer will not care the same way a fan will. Yet that shouldn't detract from how skillfully the writers and directors manage to balance so many elements and fuse so many genres to deliver a unique piece of pop-entertainment that is full of humor, spectacle, and drama.\n\nThe Avengers is not a particularly profound franchise. It doesn't attempt to be allegorical like The Lord of The Rings, it isn't as mind-expanding as The Matrix, it isn't as mystical as the original Star Wars, nor does it make any social commentary like The Dark Knight, but it has plenty of great archetypal characters who embody different aspects and struggles with heroism. Each character plays so well off the other and the cast has so much chemistry.\n\nNo other franchise understands its characters better than Marvel, and no writers have a better grasp of heroic conflict and camaraderie than Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. Comparing their work in Endgame to other franchises like the DCU's Justice League or the current Star Wars is night and day.\n\nThat isn't to say Endgame is perfect. A Masterpiece doesn't have to be perfect, and most aren't. Certain elements of the plot feel rushed and loopholes are glossed over. Not all the jokes land, but most are pretty funny. Captain Marvel is way too powerful which constantly makes her a Deus Ex Machina. There are any combination of nitpicky observations I could make about parts that don't exactly make sense, but those are minor.\n\nAdmittedly, I do have a bit of Marvel fatigue after this. It almost feels like Endgame was so epic that I don't ever need to see another super hero movie again. Sure, I'll probably see the new Spider-Man, and even though I really like the films and the character, it's reaching a point of over-saturation.", "Amazing finaleIt's definitely not as strong an impression as it was on first viewing, which makes perfect sense, but I still think the film was extremely successful on multiple levels. One of the better things is that the three-hour film is not boring at any point, it seemed to me to last \"only\" two hours, which is not easy to achieve. I also look at this film as the finale or the last episode of a series you've been watching for years, which on the one hand is actually true. So much has happened before this film, so many characters and events. This film is just the crown of it all, one big rounded whole. It is obvious that the Russo brothers had a plan because it is obvious that they paid attention to details and some smaller moments that real fans will easily recognize. Of course I have some objections that are related to certain characters and some scenes, but given the type of film and how much the film offers, I can just get over it and forget about it. I think this Marvel project is unrepeatable and it's something we should appreciate no matter what you think of movies like this.", "Everybody's hereA nice conclusion to the saga, it'll give you nerd chills", "BETTER THAN EVERY SEQUELThe sheer scale of Endgame is both its greatest strength and its most significant weakness. On one hand, the film is an epic, three-hour-long spectacle that offers a rollercoaster of emotions-grief, hope, nostalgia, and triumph. The final battle scene, where all the heroes unite against Thanos, is a jaw-dropping, cheer-inducing moment that's destined to be iconic. The visual effects are top-notch, and the action sequences are choreographed with meticulous precision.\n\nOn the other hand, the movie's scale can make it feel bloated and unwieldy. With so many characters and storylines to juggle, not all of them get the attention they deserve. Some heroes, like Captain Marvel, are underutilized, while others, like Thor, receive arcs that are divisive among fans. Thor's transformation into a depressed, beer-guzzling shadow of his former self is played for laughs but also feels like a disservice to his character development in previous films.\n\nThe time-travel plot is another area where Endgame falters. While it allows for some fantastic callbacks to earlier films and provides a clever way to undo the events of Infinity War, it also introduces a host of logical inconsistencies. The film's explanation of time travel is murky at best, and the rules seem to change whenever it's convenient for the plot. This lack of clarity can be frustrating, especially for viewers who prefer a more coherent narrative structure.", "Landmark in superhero cinemaMarvel's The Avengers is a landmark in superhero cinema, bringing together multiple characters from previous films into one action-packed, cohesive narrative. The chemistry between the ensemble cast-particularly Robert Downey Jr. As Iron Man and Chris Evans as Captain America-elevates the film, while Joss Whedon's witty script keeps it fresh. The final battle in New York is a visual spectacle, combining stunning effects with thrilling choreography. While the plot is fairly straightforward, it excels in delivering fan service and setting the foundation for future Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films.", "\"I love you 3000.\"FILM: 8.5 Rewatching Avengers: Endgame, I'm struck by how well the Russo Brothers pull off the enormous task of giving each character their due. This film had a lot riding on it, and I still find it incredibly well-made, immensely enjoyable, and ultimately satisfying. The drama is especially well done here-Marvel finally nails it after a string of more digestible, lighter stories. The weight of the stakes is felt throughout, and it's a welcome change.\n\nThe drama is where this film really shines for me. After several years of Marvel playing it safe with more easily digestible stories, Endgame takes a much-needed dive into heavier emotional territory. It's clear that Marvel finally got it right, delivering drama that feels earned and impactful. Downey Jr, Evans, and Renner are the standout beneficiaries of this approach, with the film both opening and closing with some of their best moments. Their performances anchor the story, making it feel grounded even amidst all the superhero spectacle.\n\nThe action is, as expected, top-notch, but what surprises me is the level of violence-there's a bit more edge here than I'm used to seeing in a Marvel film. It's refreshing to see some real variation and consequence in the battles, something Marvel has tried to smooth over a bit too much in the past. Watching these characters face real stakes is immensely rewarding, and it adds a layer of intensity that makes the film all the more compelling.\n\nComedy still has its place in Endgame, providing much-needed relief from the drama-heavy narrative. Thor and Rocket handle most of the humour, and while I enjoy their banter, I do feel that Thor's storyline pushes the comedy a bit too far. It sometimes feels like it's making light of what should be serious moments, which can be a bit jarring.\n\nAfter 11 years, Marvel truly delivered a fitting end to this saga. Seeing how successful it was, and how the franchise has failed to reach similar heights over the past five years, is a testament to just how well they wrapped things up.\n\nFORMAT: 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray\n\nVIDEO: 9.0 Upscaled 2160/24p presentation Detail level: Good Colour reproduction: Good Level accuracy: Excellent Encode: Excellent Master condition: Excellent\n\nAUDIO: 9.0 Dolby Atmos audio Dialogue reproduction: Excellent Soundtrack & effects clarity: Excellent Dynamics: Good Surround sound presentation: Excellent LFE content: Good\n\nMOOFIEMETER: 9.0.", "A near perfect endThis films quality depends on how you watched it and who you are. If you watched most of the MCU up to this point like I did then this will be a revolutionary endgame that redefines all of film culture. Otherwise it seems rather bad and underwhelming. The film has a forward moving plot, great acting and some CGI actually worth looking at. This film didn't become the highest grossing movie of all time for no reason. It does have some obvious flaws tropes and plot holes but other than that acts as a brilliant finale to the infinity saga. Now don't watch the multiverse saga. It willn't ruin your opinion but they aren't good sequels either. All in all a film worth watching if you have watched the entire MCU up to that point, otherwise an okay film. And watch infinity war before you watch this, otherwise literally nothing will make sense.", "So DisappointingIt's not Perfect as we imagine, There is so many curious in avengers infinity war ending & that's why people came to watch this movie in theaters.. It's not the best movie in Avengers Series.", "Absolutely amazing, but still flawed.After waiting for a year, Avengers: Endgame hit the theatres and shattered a number of box office records worldwide. But, was it really so perfectly great? No.\n\nGood : The first thing I loved about this movie was that it was the most character driven film in the MCU till date. In particular, Hawkeye and Black Widow got the most of character shine. And, it didn't have much of Captain Marvel. As someone who feels awkward when she comes on screen, it was a good thing. It did a great job of serving the fans. So many crowd pleasing moments! I was literally jumping and whistling when I was watching this film, literally. The third act is full of those moments. Those moments do come along with really good character background, a story and excitement. All of these do not make complete sense, but at least they weren't blant. And, many parts are quite nostalgic. It has tried it's best to give every character a proper arc. Performances are incredible. I didn't even hate Don Cheadle in this movie. On the whole, it was insanely entertaining and has ridiculous amount of great moments to say the least.\n\nMixed : It's not a spoiler to say it's a time travel film. While this plot device served a lot to give us a lot of crowd pleasing moments, each of which I really loved, the whole time travel part could've been even more epic and exciting than it was. There were parts in Infinity War where it jumped from plotline to plotline. This one does the same, but it looked more choppy here. Not necessarily a bad thing, a movie of this scale would have such problems. But it was a bit more distracting than before. I admit I liked many arcs given to the characters. But, they were still a bit illogical, in particular that of Steve Rogers. Many things were entertaining as hell, but still quite paradoxical.\n\nBad : It's a time travel movie. It generates a lot many plot holes and inconsistencies. It uses time travel as an excuse for getting certain things done. It has the most generic issues of a non sci-fi time travel movie. The timeline surely is messed up now. I don't know how the time travel in this universe works and how certain things were amended due to all of these time travelling stuffs. May be I will never know. And Thanos. He was treated more like a mustache twirling villain, rather than how he was in Infinity War. The way his character ended was the most disappointing part of the movie. It feels as if it tries to be as big as Infinity War while it clearly isn't.\n\nConclusion : You can and must watch this film. It's a film by the Russo Brothers, you can definitely count on them for an entertaining film, but this is perhaps their weakest film in the MCU. It isn't well paced as Infinity War is, but still gives all the moments you can wish for. Infinity War is a whole lot better than this film, but is still a worth watching flick. If you stop thinking about the inconsistencies time travel creates in this film, this will be a much better experience.\n\nRating.\n\nScore : 8.9/10\n\nGrade : A", "Is it a great film? Does it matter?No one goes to see a comic book movie expecting to see an art house film. It happens sometimes but it is not the normal. What you expect to see is a fun movie with some philosophical concept and some emotional depth, comic books were never just about the action. So is this a great film? I don't care. Watching it I never stopped to think if there are plot holes or if the cinematography is good, I just enjoyed it. And enjoyed almost everything about it. The Russo brothers are not the new Goddard or the new Bergman (or even the new Spielberg) but they are talented and intellectual people, they had a goal and they delivered by not only doing fan service but also story service. The MCU has a great future.\n\nSo, is it a great film? Comparing it with cinematic masterpieces I could give it a 6-7/10. Comparing it with other blockbuster movies I could give it a 12/10, it's that good...", "One of the fastest 3 hours of my life!A colossal conclusion, a proper ending for an epic saga. It brought you to the beginning, it remind you of all the years you have invested. Then boom, here is that dessert that make you overwhelmed and craved at the same time. It closed one door to open up another, there is still a new journey ahead of us. Great execution by Joe and Anthony Russo!", "A great conclusionAvengers: Endgame is not a perfect movie, but it feels like one. Every character get an end to their arcs, and the film itself is a great conclusion to 11 years of movies, all of which have led up to this. I wont spoil the actual plot for those who haven't seen it (the trailers have been incredible at not revealing anaything), but I will say that it is full of surprises, shocks, laughs and tears. The fact that the film manages to be THIS good more than makes up for its few flaws. The final battle is probably the most fan-pleasing, epic and emotionaly packed action sequence in any superhero movie; it was the culmiation if 11 years of characters we've come to love and care about. This is what superhero movies are all about.", "Avengers: Endgame sticks the landingGo ahead and watch the trailers for Avengers: Endgame, they won't give anything major away. It's amazing for a huge movie to be so self-aware of itself, as well as, the movie genres that they're overtly borrowing from. The minor characters or those not even in Avengers: Infinity War, step up and help set up huge sequences that are highly entertaining and actually answer questions. Avengers: Endgame acknowledges every aspect of the characters emotions in their previous MCU film's and succeeds in the most Meta way possible.\n\nAnt-Man is a major reason for this. It's no spoiler to say that he's in the film as he produces some of the biggest laughs from the trailer of him ringing the bell at the Avenger's front gate. It's Paul Rudd's wry jokes, quick timing and fish out of water facial expressions that really assist things.\n\nThe pacing of Avengers: Endgame is amazing and not for the reasons you might think. It's brilliantly paced, but it throws the entire formula and how MCU films are done on their head. Battle, loss, battle, loss, humor and then victory, take those ingredients, shake well and you've got a loose description of some average superhero films.\n\nIf Avengers: Infinity War left you feeling betrayed and bummed out, I feel you. Avengers: Endgame more than makes up for any ill feelings that it caused. I see why they played it the way they did, and doing so any other way would've cheapened the film, watered down the MCU and made it all disposable. It is also worth noting that the film balance lots of humor with the drama, all the while putting it in a nice bow with stones.\n\nWhat we're left with is a 10 year opus that spans more arcs than Lord of the Rings and encapsulates it all in a perfect manner. Granted, they will still make many MCU films, this is not their swan song. However, there is a victory lap feeling about Avengers: Endgame. It respects the fans, adds to the dramatic elements, answers questions that fans have wondered about and plants a couple new seeds to grow on.\n\nIs Avengers: Endgame OK for children? If your child has seen any MCU film then they'll be OK with this. The film has fair number of bad words, but the violence is on par with what younger fans are accustomed to. For example, there isn't any one instance that's as graphic as when the monster ate the businessman in Shazam!, but there are sustained action sequences that might test those 8 years old who haven't seen an MCU movie before.", "One of the best films of all time (In its own way)!Marvel has completely taken over the film industry, and the addition of this film will speed up that process even more. This film is enjoyed the most when the audience is knowledgeable of the marvel cinematic universe and it enhances the emotions of the audience due to the bond forged through the commitment of watching all 21 films before Endgame. If someone were to ask me: \"Is it one of the best films you have ever seen?\" I would reply: \"It is the best film if all time, in its own way\" \"Its stands alone, away from every other film, because it is so different to anything i have ever watched before.\"", "A Satisfying ConclusionAvengers Endgame Review Score - 10/10 Avengers Endgame could be well described as the most complicated storyline in the entire Marvel history not only because it had to wrap up a story of eleven years but also because of the complex solution to an inevitable situation that The Avengers try to achieve with the avenging not being the major part of the story. The three hour runtime was well utilized by giving more time to establish the characters' humanistic attachments and the losses they suffered; not only in this movie, but from the very moment they've been incepted into this franchise. Unlike the previous outings, the characters differ in their choices and these contrasts in their choices lead up to one massive and satisfying final battle which may not end the entire MCU, but certainly does end a glorious era of the long franchise. The entire movie, especially the final battle was a huge fan service as it included everything a Marvel fan could possibly dream of. PS: There is no Post - Credits Scene in the film, but it is worth waiting for the entire credits to roll.", "A well-made and well-deserved victory lap for the MCUAvengers: Endgame is a well-made and well-deserved victory lap for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It ties in many different storylines from previous films and allows you to reminisce while also saying goodbye to characters you've known and loved. This film has some flaws, of course, but it also made some bold choices and surprised me a number of times. I laughed. I cried. I loved this finale to the Infinity Saga.", "The only reason it's not a 10Not enough time for all the characters. Should have been a two parter", "The end of an Era. Onto the next one.This movie isn't perfect.

And to me it is LEGEND.Scenes was awesome. The scenario was awesome.I think every marvel fan should watch this movie...", "PERFECT MOVIEIt was a marvels fans dream. Loved it all the way. The perfect end to all the fans, giving moments of full action. Avengers: Endgame shows an incredible connection between all the movies of this amazing universe developed among eleven years. Yes it slows down a bit. But over all a visual treat I must say.", "Well done Marvel, thanks for everythingThe avengers go out with a bang in this movie. It's fun, it's emotional, it's action packed, it has surprises, it does the ending of the avengers movies justice. It starts out slower but it's all worth it for the end. It had moments where people cried, clapped and gasped. Go see it!", "Avengers: Endgame\"Avengers: Endgame\" is the culmination of a decade of blockbuster filmmaking, the result of years of work from thousands of people. It is designed to be the most blockbuster of all the blockbusters, a movie with a dozen subplots colliding, and familiar faces from over 20 other movies. It's really like nothing that Hollywood has produced before, existing not just to acknowledge or exploit the fans of this series, but to reward their love, patience, and undying adoration. The blunt thing you probably want to know most: It's hard to see serious MCU fans walking away from this disappointed. It checks all the boxes, even ticking off a few ones that fans won't expect to be on the list. It's a satisfying end to a chapter of blockbuster history that will be hard to top for pure spectacle. In terms of sheer entertainment value, it's on the higher end of the MCU, a film that elevates its most iconic heroes to the legendary status they deserve and provides a few legitimate thrills along the way.", "Avengers: Endgame is some of the most thrilling, powerful, beautiful, and emotional entertainment ever put on the big screen.When I walked into the theater for my first viewing of Endgame, I was prepared to see a great superhero movie. I expected some massive fight scenes, a few emotional gut punches, and to walk away with a generic positive message about overcoming obstacles. But I could have never guessed that night that I would cry like a baby, go completely numb from pure awe, and leave the theater with a fresh take on what it really means to be human. It was a night I'll likely remember for the rest of my life.\n\nIt all started back in 2008 with the first Iron Man, which was soon followed by several other movies based on popular superheroes from Marvel comics. These superheroes became known as Avengers, appearing together in several blockbuster hits to fight world-threatening enemies. Endgame is the culmination of 22 movies across 11 years, and the anticipation and pressure from the fans were higher than ever before. But somehow, Marvel managed to produce an overwhelmingly satisfying conclusion that met or exceeded all expectations.\n\nThe premise of Endgame's storyline is fairly simple: defeat the mad titan Thanos after he wiped out half the universe's population and bring back everyone he killed. However, it ends up quite complex, dealing with quantum physics and time travel. The directors, Joe and Anthony Russo, do an admirable job of making the storyline easy to follow, bouncing between dozens of different settings and timelines without feeling too cluttered. There are also a surprisingly low number of plot holes considering that the movie deals with time travel.\n\nWhen it comes to pacing, the film has some minor issues. It sometimes feels unnecessarily drawn out during some of the middle sections, where the movie takes a less serious tone and the stakes don't feel quite as high. But it more than makes up for it with an action packed beginning and ending filled with shocking surprises and adrenaline rushes to keep the audience on the edge of their seats.\n\nOne of the movie's most impressive feats is how it is able to include so many characters without making a single one feel left out. The main characters of this movie are the original six Avengers, which include Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Black Widow, Hawkeye, and the Hulk. Apart from the Hulk, who unfortunately does not get much of a spotlight, all of their characters develop beautifully throughout the movie and have several major moments to shine. Iron Man in particular ends up almost the complete opposite of his selfish, egotistical, and ignorant past self. Even Thanos, despite being the main antagonist, has a very interesting arc that affects his grand motives as he learns more about humanity's flaws.\n\nAs we have come to expect from marvel, the production quality is as good as it gets. The acting performances from all the cast members are easily some of the best they have ever done. Whether through dialogue or simply just facial expressions, the actors and actresses do an amazing job conveying their characters' emotions. The visuals are stunning, with a vibrant color palate and awe inspiring cinematography. The movie relies heavily on cgi, but it is done so well that everything looked completely photorealistic. Accompanying that was a stellar soundtrack by Alan Silvestri that masterfully matches the tone of each scene, elevating them to new heights. \"Portals\" in particular is one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard, and it still gives me major chills every time I listen to it.\n\nThe movie particularly excels at creating a very atmospheric feel to many of its scenes, using it's soundtrack and visuals to immerse the viewer into its vast world. Some of the best examples of this are in an early scene with Iron Man in a spaceship, which wonderfully captures the melancholic but peaceful tone of the scene. And perhaps the most prominent example is in the iconic \"Portals\" scene, which emanates sheer awe with its beauty and scope, starting slowly and naturally building up to an earth-shattering climax.\n\nA common criticism with superhero movies in general is that they are mindless \"popcorn entertainment\" only good for action and surprises. However, with Endgame, this could not be further from the truth. Through the Avengers' personal struggles and Thanos's quest to make a perfect universe, the film goes the extra mile in showing how the world and its people are far from perfect, but our lives can still be beautiful. This idea is especially shown within the deeply moving final few scenes.\n\nAvengers: Endgame is a wonderfully thrilling experience for its audience. But it goes a step further and shows us why cinema and storytelling are so important. As Endgame illustrates, emotions are defining characteristics of humanity, and whether good or bad, they shape our lives and allow us to grow. What better way to experience these emotions than through some amazing stories?", "Electrified and emotedFrom the beginning to end the characters are very alive and at the beginning we never going to believe that is gonna happened but it does and after that the movie been a roller coaster and the climax is the generator of goosebumps and at end for me its a pain to dilute the truth. Over all its an perfect ending to the greatest franchise in marvel universe.", "\ud83d\udc4cRobert Downey JR needs an Oscar. Fantastic performance", "It has all come to thisIt has taken many years and lots of work to build up to this amazing movie. This completely satisfied and exceeded my expectations for how I hoped they would pull this all off. I have been a huge fan of the movies leading up to this and this did it all justice. All the hidden \"Easter eggs\" from the other installments have been hinting towards this and I can't believe how big this has all gotten over the years. I was glad to see that even though this movie had a very serious fight at hand that there was still some classic Marvel comedy that made for some very funny moments. There was laughter, tears, and cheers through this movie. It was an emotional roller coaster that I already plan on going to again soon in theaters. It is a must see for those who have already been fans of the MCU and if you haven't followed it to this point this movie won't make sense or mean much to you so go back and watch the other movies. It is all worth it.", "Disneys Dark Knight Rises, by way of Inception.I'll start by saying before Infinity War, I always thought that most Marvel films were a 6 or 7 out of 10 for me, they were all enjoyable, however the thing they so drastically lacked was a strong baddie. My issue with the first Avengers was Loki being so non threatening, and everyone I talk to about this seems to agree, however the breakthrough at the time was just to have all their heroes on screen together. You then had Avengers Age of Ultron, which had the baddie being a creation of Tony Stark, which I found unexciting, despite it being a fun watch. The two impressive Captain America sequels, the third of which had our heroes fighting against each other, again something I found to be a little underwhelming.\n\nThen came Infinity War, which for me totally raised the bar, and properly introduced one of the most threatening, and in my opinion Iconic baddies we have seen on the screen since Nolans Bane in TDKR. I was extremely dissapointed to not see more people dressed up as the mad titan last Halloween (no shortage of Harley Quinns and Jokers still). Infinity War ended with what is unquestionably the greatest shock in superhero film history, which then set up what promised to be a fascinating follow up.\n\nThis film did not disappoint, and even if you are not a fan of superhero movies in general, I would strongly urge any film fan to at least watch both Infinity War and Endgame both. I am certain even the most hard nosed film critic (the type that boo every film at Cannes) can appreciate the quality of film-making on display here.\n\nI have seem some passionate YouTubers making videos about plot-holes being uncovered throughout this film, however given the direction the story took, I can imagine the difficulty the filmmakers had weaving this all together, and I am confident they did the best they could.\n\nEssential viewing.", "such a expensive warThe story picks up after the devastating events of Avengers: Infinity War, where Thanos wiped out half of all life in the universe. The surviving heroes must regroup and come up with a plan to undo the destruction and defeat Thanos once and for all. The film explores themes of loss, redemption, and the lengths people will go to save those they love. Endgame excels in its ability to deliver on fan expectations while also providing surprising and emotional moments. The film's pacing, while slower in the first half, allows for deep character development and reflection, making the final act's payoff even more powerful. The climactic battle scene is one of the most epic and visually stunning in cinematic history, bringing together nearly every hero from the MCU.", "respectOne sound,and half of all life in the universe goes up in smoke. Super heroes rise and fall for what they believe in. Endings are part of the process,thank you for having such a happy, unforgettable and eternal journey in these ten years of my life.", "The endThis movie was genious for some reason,less action i know.but at the end this movie was a masterpiece on many ways,ill be waiting for more marvel movies for now.", "9/10A great ending, to a much loved saga. It would have been very easy for Marvel to mess this one up, but it delivered in all aspects.", "A fitting climaxIt's fair to say that this is a fitting climax not only to the avengers movies, but a large section of the Marvel universe. The film is action packed, generally keeps you at the edge of your seat, and remains faithful to the characters. It's long, but quite necessarily so.", "Marvel-lousIt can't get better than this. Best MCU and Marvel movie IMO.", "thoroughly enjoyableFilm which triggered a lot of emotion. Fantastic end to the franchise.", "Too muchPart 1 of the 2 final movies was perfect. Character development was still going forward. Endgame is nothing but a screen full of the characters we have come to know and love. It tried to tell too much so what we ended up with was clips and a lot of jumping around. It was like a movie made up of movie preview clips. What a let down after all these years.", "Avengers: Endgame (Short Movie Review)Positives:\nDirecting, script and cinematography\nMain cast\nAction scenes\nMost of the humor\nScope\nIt was a perfect conclusion for 22 movies in 11 years\n\n\nNegatives:\nNot much", "Perfect Conclusion, for now at least, of the Avengers Storyline!!!I was a little late watching this one and had heard a lot of mixed reviews leading up to doing so; however, I personally thought this was the best possible conclusion to the current Avengers storyline. Or... the conclusion for now at least.\n\nFirst of all, I really enjoyed getting to see a more human side of all the Avengers in this one. I thought the film makers did an amazing job at really giving us the time to connect with each and every super hero in this franchise if we hadn't thus far. Doing so really helped set the stage for the \"Endgame\", if you will. I really enjoyed the main characters throughout this film as well. I thought Thanos had wiped out the majority of my favorites with his infinity stone snap, but I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed the remaining characters and how well they worked together throughout the film.\n\nAlso, I just can't say enough about how beautiful the Marvel films are and how well the CGI, costumes, and FX are done. For a film series that relies so heavily on FX and CGI, they manage to pull it off so smoothly and seamlessly.\n\nIt's hard to go too far with a review without giving away any of the storyline; however, I feel that any true fan has already seen the film at this point. For those who haven't I can only say to come out from under the rock you're living under and check out this amazing piece of cinema history.\n\nI give Avengers: Endgame a 9 out of 10!!!\n\nPS - Captain Marvel is soooooo badass!!!!", "10 years of continuity concluded in a near perfect film.It was always going to be a challenge to create a movie that neatly ties up a decade of continuity and juggles a cast of characters built up over 22 films and the fear was that End Game was going to be anticlimactic. Fans do not fear, the Russo's have crafted a near perfect film from its heart wrenching opening to its close. You'll laugh, you'll cheer, you'll weep and you'll leave the cinema pretty happy with the experience. If you are new to the Marvel Universe then this is not for you and will appear to be a jumbled mess of a film but for anyone who has been in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since Iron Man back in 2008 this is everything you wanted to see.", "Best MCU movie ever made, Expect The Unexpected Ending. Perfect Ending (9/10)I am waiting for this movie from the day I watched Avengers Assemble movie in 2012... Perfect Ending.\n\nThere is no movie such grand in past or in recent times, not even star wars( sorry fans but its the fact). Marvel put every trick possible in this movie.

Marvel fans mustn't have been spoiled before watching this. But it may be not so friendly to newcomers. If the 181 minutes were full of excitements that would be definitely ok but actually there're a significant amount of quiet and peaceful moments, puzzling people who watch Marvel film for the first time. I don't know how would a Marvel fan judge them.", "\"Endgame\" not only delivers a cathartic experience greater than Infinite Warfare, but it also establishes definitive positions regarding the MCU's destiniesFinally, the long-awaited conclusion of a saga that was weaved ingeniously and meticulously for a decade by the House of Ideas, under the command of Kevin Feige. If before the studios practically did not bet on superhero films, ten years ago this reality changed completely when we saw \"Iron Man (2008)\" debut in theaters around the world, beginning a wide, complex and detailed shared universe, which gave life to characters that fans so longed to see transported to the cinema and becoming acquainted with others not so popular even among comic book fans. There were three phases that became known as the \"Infinity Saga\", in which we became intimate with Iron Homme, Captain America, Hulk, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Thor, Ant-Man, Spider-Man, Captain Marvel, Black Panther, Guardians of the Galaxy and Doctor Strange.\n\nFilmed simultaneously with \"Infinite War\", the Russo brothers and screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely continue to tell the story of the previous film. Here, superheroes must deal with the events of the previous film, in which half of the people in the galaxy were wiped out at Thanos' snap, including friends and family of our heroes. Those who are left are still, for more than three weeks, trying to locate Thanos who entered a portal and disappeared, while trying to find a solution to reverse what had happened.\n\nThe first fifteen minutes invest in revenge and the consummation of failure: an introduction. The next sequences, which make up a first, more melancholic, yet vigorous act in re-presenting characters and renewing the previous status quo, have an emphasis on the intimate, precisely what drives Ultimato as an experience: a great show on a colossal scale, but that cares about a dance, a feeling, a heart, a family.\n\n\"Ultimatum\" gets it right by dedicating more than half its duration to intensify the hopelessness, mourning and disbelief that the characters and the audience were going through together. In that time, he takes the opportunity to strengthen ties between unlikely characters, such as Toby Stark and Nebula, and also to show how old friends, such as Natasha, Rogers and Barton, Tony and Thor and Bruce, led their lives five years after the events of the beginning of the movie. The characters have their own layers, monsters and voids, to add to the project itself, which is a mooring of several narrative arches, the sustenance of a three-hour cathartic work. Especially interesting is Tony's bow, living alongside his great love and his little daughter, being the counterpoint to Barton, who had his life transformed after the loss of his family, becoming a vengeful murderer who eliminates those he does not consider worthy. Meanwhile, Carol Danvers went on to help other planets that also suffered from Thanos' actions.\n\nAfter the presentation of the current situation of each of the heroes, it is when Scott Lang enters the story, who managed to return from the quantum kingdom, after the post-credits scenes that we had followed in \"Ant Man and the Wasp\". He then explains that the laws of physics and space-time do not apply to the quantum realm, theorizing that they could travel through time through the Pym Particles and the portal. From there, after seeing an old photo of him with Peter Parker, Tony ends the time travel equation and the Avengers, with the exception of Danvers, split into groups to return to the past and retrieve the Infinity Stones and that's when Marvel takes audiences on an unforgettable journey celebrating 11 years of their shared universe, revisiting films like \"The Avengers\", \"Captain America 2: The Winter Soldier\", \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" and even the controversial \"Thor: The Dark World\" .\n\nBanner, Rogers, Lang and Stark return to 2012, during Loki's invasion of New York, to retrieve the Tesseract, Loki's scepter and the Eye of Agamotto. They also end up going to 1970 at the S.H.I.E.L.D. in Lehigh to get another version of the Tesseract, which was being tested by the military and to get more particles from Hank Pym, who had just invented them. Meanwhile, Thor and Rocket return to Asgard in 2013 to extract Jane Foster's Reality Gem. Clint and Natasha return to Vormir in 2014 to retrieve the Soul Gem, while Rhodes and Nebula go to Morag, also in 2014, where Peter Quill is about to steal the Gem of Power. This whole time travel will culminate in the great final battle, after Thanos discovering the heroes' plan, where the destiny of the universe will be at stake again.\n\nThe cast reaches the height of their characters' understanding, completing a whole development arc. In addition to the main cast, which is already extremely numerous, there are still several cameos from great actors and actresses who showed up in previous productions. Robert Redford, Michelle Pfeiffer, Michael Douglas, Tilda Swinton, Natalie Portman, William Hurt, are just a few of those names, and some of them literally go silent and leave quietly.\n\nWith a million dollar budget of US $ 356 million, the film justifies the use of every penny and obviously will not have any difficulty in recovering and sometimes exceeding the high amount invested. They are effects used for the rejuvenation of characters, the construction of scenarios from different eras and worlds, dozens of intergalactic beings from the most different backgrounds and visual effects of a scale and perfection rarely seen. Not for nothing, \"Ultimatum\" was nominated for an Oscar in the category. Few times have we seen so many characters gathered together, with several actions taking place simultaneously, and everything wonderfully orchestrated by the precise direction of the Russo brothers, who manage to maintain a perfect unity and synchrony. The final battle against Thanos that takes up almost the entire last hour of the three that lasts the film, will be remembered as one of the biggest and most spectacular in the history of cinema. There, we can see the full potential of all the heroes presented by the MCU in these years should be a delight for fans of the universe. Not to mention the emotional and beautifully post-battle scenes that tie up all the last loose ends of the Infinity Saga. The audience is in tears. And it is not a daydream or exaggeration.\n\nThe soundtrack by Alan Silvestri, responsible for the famous Avengers theme, composed for the 2012 film, is once again perfect, elevating drama, melancholy and epic action to the tenth power. In the musical part, \"Dear Mr. Fantasy\", by Traffic, \"Supersonic Rocket Ship\", by The Kinks, \"Doom and Gloom\" by the Rolling Stones and \"Hey Lawdy Mama\", by Steppenwolf are some of the songs that are present. The production designer of the always competent Charles Wood and photography by Trent Opaloch, who uses and abuses the darkest filters that give the greatest degree of drama and pessimism that guide much of the feature film are used with mastery.\n\nThroughout the film, the Russo brothers think millimetrically about each scene, sometimes to make the audience cry, sometimes to laugh and sometimes to cheer for the heroes in their battles. As well as the conclusion of the saga \"Harry Potter\", \"Star Wars\" and \"Lord of the Rings\", the great megalomaniac of \"Ultimatum\" will remain in the minds of the moviegoers as one of those epic films that practically everyone has watched. And the end, still holds great surprises, some that envision a future of the Universe, such as those involving Thor and The Guardians of the Galaxy and the passing of Captain America's baton.\n\n\"Ultimatum\" works above all expectations: it not only delivers a cathartic experience greater than Infinite Warfare, but it also establishes definitive positions regarding the MCU's destinies. The film proves to have been planned in detail by the studio's creative minds, who know more than anyone else, how to please their audience. Although \"Ultimatum\" seems to be the end of the Infinity Saga, phase 3 will officially end with \"Spider-Man: Far From Home\", which should still have consequences for this film in the life of Peter Parker, especially with the death of someone very close and dear to the hero.", "thanks to the movieI'm a post-90s person, and I used to envy the \"previous generation\" : People who saw the final episode of the Star Wars Trilogy 40 years ago, and people who saw the final chapter of the Lord of the Rings series 20 years ago.

The farwell to some epic characters will definitely hit hard to every loyal marvel fan. The movie had its moments of action, laughter , sadness , togetherness and mindblowing climax. It wont be wrong to say the climax way up higher than the actual expectations. Despite its long run time of 3 hours it stills feels less for such kind of conclusion. The movie had its share of flaws but that does not lets you feel bored even for second. There are movies which are applauded for its story and peformances in the very highly recoginzed festivals around the globe unlike them this movie is itself a festival filled with memorable characters from the marvel cinematic universe. They are the characters who have such an impact that they will remain in the hearts of people for generations to come. This movie belongs to more of scifi or fantasy genre which are far from reality but the presentation of its imagination is delivered in such a way that you get sucked into its virtual universe. There are many series , sequels or combined universe movies who have actually failed to live up to its previous installment. Unlike them marvel universe continues to get bigger better and blockbuster with every passing follow ups. This movie is highly entertaining and enchancting equally to the fans as well as beginners. It definitely deserves a perfect score as it does its best in its own genre and movies as such will be not played be on screen every year.

The movie was great, not as good as Infinity War but not terrible as people are making out. I understand the critisism but people rating below a 5 are clearly fan based blind.", "Saving the best for lastEveryone and their mother has likely talked about how this film is over a decade in the making so I won't bring that up to much except to say that this film, like Infinity War, relies on that history. And this is a good thing as it has a lot of new content that builds off that foundation. Avengers: Endgame is filled with some shocking twists, heart wrenching deaths, and amazing cinematic moments you will never forget. If you even slightly enjoy the Marvel films, you cannot pass up seeing this movie. If Infinity War was daring in using most of its run time for villain focus and battles, this one is unique in how different its three acts are from one another. It makes the film quite re-watchable despite its length. And it all leads up to a finale you have to see to believe. Characters like Iron Man, Black Widow, Hawkeye, and Captain America shine like never before, as the writing for characters is incredibly strong in this movie. I would not say this is the best Avengers film. Its pacing can seem sluggish the first time around and some characters are treated as jokes more than they ought. However, the final act utilizes even its weaknesses to deliver on a satisfying conclusion. The only question left in your mind will be \"Where will Marvel take us next?\"", "A Greatly Done Final Film.This was one of the best Marvel films ever, it was a great watch, and as someone who has complete invested into the MCU, I can say that this was a greta finish to a great film series.", "I just review this title because...Bye bye Avatar! :) Endgame come to you!

A must watch!", "Not sure where to rate this...I'm not sure where to rate this movie because there's a lot of different angles to it. There are many plot holes. There is some humor that doesn't work as well as I'd like it to. I don't believe it's the best marvel movie. BUT... this movie is awesome. Make me feel something real from just a screen and you've achieved something and the Russo brothers did just that. Yes, the time travel logic will definitely not be accurate if you take the \"time\" (see what I did there) to dissect it, but this film did something pretty new. It connected over 20 movies into one grand conclusion that pays off better than any other piece of media that I've ever seen. Problems with the flick? A few sure. Any resentment? Pretty much none. You can't please everyone, but these guys probably did the best job they could and I love them 3000", "Made for the fansEleven-year wait is finally over. The Endgame hit theatres on April 24th, and the word \"hit\" might be the best way to put it. The culmination of a comic-book phenomenon called \"The Avengers\" is set to become the most successful film in terms of box-office gross, as well as be generally regarded as the best comic-book movie ever made.\n\nThe story takes place in the so-called MCU, a universe where all the superheroes reside. Established 11 years ago with the release of the first film, The Iron Man, at that time tricky move has proven to be a resounding success and changed the lives of everyone involved. Marvel managed to build a universe so mesmerizing it has made fans always coming back for more. With the last film closing the chapter, it was Marvel's responsibility to do justice to this franchise. And it seems that they didn't disappoint.\n\nThe film plays on a sentimental note, leaving viewers with a nostalgic feeling. This is done by referencing to the past movies, and even revisiting the old sets. Slightly less action-packed than the former Infinity War, The Endgame focuses on the journey of the original Avengers, but still, or perhaps because of this, manages to take many surprising turns. It is nothing new that the stories of some of these characters are coming to an end, but don't make this prevent you from going to see this film! The death sequences are dealt with graciously, avoiding overused clich\u00e9s. They leave you feeling heart-broken, but also satisfied with the epic conclusion.\n\nThe only think that I find to be irritating was the song repertoire. Although the songs usually fit the scenes in which they appeared, they didn't tie the story together, making it a little chaotic and inconsistent.\n\nAll in all, The Endgame is an achievement in both, cinematography and storytelling, and is a must-see for every cinephile.", "A true love letter for the real fansEither bitter DC fans or people with short attention spans seem to be dissing this magnificent film. In order to get the most from Endgame it really does require you to have seen most of the previous MCU films. It's emotional payoff is probably the most rewarding of any film I have ever seen. It's funny, it's sad, it's exciting at the same time. It's not perfect, no film is. Perfection doesn't exist. It's an unattainable construct. However I truly feel it is the best possible version of the final chapter of the MCU any fan could have asked for. Nuff said.", "I'm not crying ur crying!I have no words for how bittersweet this movie was. I'm not in the habit of spoilers so have no fear this review has none of them. I can say you'll be amazing, you'll laugh and of course you'll cry..but for me I'm kinda upset in a way like a bittersweet chocolate bar I really like but kinda I hate I ate way..lol. And I know these are fictional characters and I shouldn't be so invested but that's what Marvel and The Russo Brothers do..they have taken us on this journey with these characters and now it's like we're all hanging over this cliffside with them..not knowing where or how the journey will end knowing we probably won't looking away cause we love them. I just don't know if I can move on with the next phase.. theses dorks are my people and I think they outdone themselves this time.", "Avengers-palooza!This is a kitchen sink movie, in that you get everything but the kitchen sink in it! The three hours flies by mostly due to the fact that the action rarely stops. It's a movie filled with laughs and tears and goodbyes. A couple of scenes seemed shoe horned in to appease the folks clamoring for more \"Woke\" moments. Those scenes aside, most of this epic movie is solidly put together and wonderfully presented. Without spoiling anything, I was scratching my head at some of the logic behind science in the movie that goes against every thing any movie viewer has ever seen, but I have a policy of throwing logic to the wind on super hero movies. What's the point when you have people flying and teleporting across space. I've read this movie is a love letter to fans of the MCU. I'd agree with that, and would add that if it was a love letter, Robert Downey Jr. signature would be at the end, in the center, and slightly larger than anyone else.", "This proves the longstanding effect of emotional investment in moviesI would like to assure all readers that I will not be including any spoilers from Avengers: Endgame. This film, according to me, is the finest comic book adaptation I have seen in the form of a movie. This humanised so many heroes that we are used to seeing fight Godly beings. Regardless of the long 182 minutes runtime, the pacing of this film is impeccable. Never does this film seem convoluted or exhaustingly long. However, a note for the non-Marvel viewers contemplating watching this film - this may be difficult to follow if you have not seen most of the previous films, at least the sequences in the middle of the film. For the fans, this really does pay off the 10 years of commitment you have exhibited and shown. Having seen the events of 21 films coalesce here is a privilege for me. I loved every moment and part of the film to the core.", "The End of An Era in Epic StyleThe end of an era, Endgame wraps up the Infinity Saga in epic fashion, with massive fan service, emotional gravitas, a darker Thanos, psychological war-aftermath reflection, & one of the greatest final acts in blockbuster history. 9.4/10.\n\n...\n\n10 years, 21 movies, 32 heroes. The MCU as we know it just came to an end, and did so as epically as one could have possibly expected. Avengers: Endgame is one of, if not THE best and definitive Marvel film - and absolutely warrants the hype.\n\nThe film opens into a desolate landscape post-Infinity War where our heroes are still coming to terms with the magnitude of their failure. Despite glimpses of levity-full psychological war aftermath reflection on topics like survivor's guilt and PTSD, I'll admit: I was mildly disappointed with the first act. Overly comedic and light-defused in tone, it's a bit discordant with the tragic events that just happened to trillions of life forms. It was also a bit anticlimactic having them find and confront Thanos so easily and early. However, these flaws are mostly sequestered in the first third (despite a weird intellectual Hulk and fat Thor just horrifying to watch), and are ~easily forgiven in light of what follows.\n\nEverything after the first act is masterful, dazzling fan service on a massive scale that will leave any Marvel or superhero fan speechless with their jaw-dropped. The middle act's time travel plotting makes for some incredible scenarios visiting past MCU films and having heroes interacting with their past selves. This was the magic of DC's Flashpoint comic arc, and although the film borrows its idea, it executes it perfectly. Thrillingly paced are the signature smooth-fluid action sequences The Russo Brothers are known for and exhibited ever since The Winter Soldier, as well as strong direction and intricate handling of such a monstrous scale of a story arc trying to beat Thanos before he even knows what's happened.\n\nThe Avengers once again find solace in the splitting up of them into mini-teams leading to some hilarious and intriguing character combinations different from Infinity War. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow, Hawkeye now Ronin, and the rest of the original 6 (plus a few others) are sent off into different teams and time periods to retrieve the stones, and it makes for some incredible entertainment value alone worth the price of admissions to watch. The Easter Eggs and cameos are downright legendary, showcasing what we already learned in IW: Anthony and Joe Russo are huge Marvel junkies who know and love the films/comics as much as the person reading this review.\n\nThanos and his far darker tone. Thanos is also off scouring for the Stones while all this is happening. His pulling of the strings in things like sending rogues and strategically planting things to upset the Avengers' plans make him far more imposing than his rogue commando style in IW. Much akin to what Darkseid - DC's original titan/god that came out first and, yes, Thanos was cloned from - would be like, there's far more power in resources at your disposal and being able to fling them at your will. He also has a bite and far darker tone here, being pissed off The Avengers are wrecking his plans after knowing he won and promising to not only kill half of life now, but ALL life and start over again under his rule.\n\nFinally, the final act. I cannot even find the words to describe how legendary the final act of Endgame is - it might be one of the greatest final acts in blockbuster HISTORY. Like the Wakanda war on acid, this massive scale battle starting with the three most iconic Avengers against Thanos and evolving into a sheer epic warzone with every Marvel character you could possibly imagine, it will leave any fan speechless. And that's nothing compared to the heart-breaking ending with sacrifices that do the characters proud and have potentially-massive implications for the future of the MCU.\n\nOverall, while there are nits to pick from its ~anticlimactic humorous opening to its handling of Thor/Hulk to its lack of a post-credits scene (REALLY wanted an X-Men or Eternals tease..), Avengers: Endgame is an absolutely masterful film that delivers just about everything you could expect from it as a follow-up to Infinity War. The end of an era, Avengers: Endgame wraps up the Infinity Saga in epic fashion, with massive fan service, emotional gravitas, a darker Thanos, psychological war aftermath reflection, and one of the greatest final acts in blockbuster HISTORY. It will be dang near impossible to wait to see what comes next.\n\nOverall Score: 9.4/10", "Great pPotential Wasted by Weak WritingWell, this has been what we all have been waiting for quite some time now. 10 years in making, characters we grew find of and vast and complex storylines. They all have ended up to this movie. I wanted to watch this movie on the opening night and couldn't wait to get in. As someone who has been following the Marvel universe fairly thoroughly and watched almost all of the movies leading to this one multiple times, to be honest, I wasn't blown away. The problem for me was that while I was enjoying the movie, I couldn't help but to realize this is going to be THE last one, so all of a sudden I wasn't that impress with the way many scenes were being handled. Especially, when you compare it to some of the other Marvel movies which were fantastic. If I were to single out one problem, it would be poor writing. I don't know whether they had time issue or spmething else but the material is so weak and the dialogues are so forgettable and superficial that were robbing the beauty out of the fantastic visual effects and sound effects and acceptable directing and casting. There were numerous occasions I was literally yearning for a killer line by the characters to hit me write in the heart and lingers with me for the rest of my life but the magic was far far from there. It was weird in a sense that they have already had many splendid writings in the Marvel movies to this date but why the most important chapter (the finale) should be like this is truly astonishing. All in all, it is not a bad movie in any ways but for the folks who have been following the Marvel movies seriously or semi-seriously, you will be a little disappointed that why this potential has been wasted in this way.", "Wow!! SpeechlessWow, just Wow! This movie has it all and needs to be watched PERIOD!!", "Excellent sequel!The almost 3 hours flew by with great writing and effects, and the change of the characters lives made it that much more entertaining - especially Thor! Better than I expected, and a wee bit better than the last film imo. 9/10", "the best end for the best sagaThis film concludes an era, both of Marvel and of my heart. The Avengers were a fundamental part of my childhood and raised me by giving me sources of inspiration that I would not have found without them. This film for its importance and also its beauty, is the best Marvel movie of all time. I'm just sad to think that it's all over, but I'm glad that you had the best possible conclusion, for what has been the best movie house ever, which has succeeded most of the time in confirming itself with great superhero films. Needless to say, without these actors would not have been the same story. Robert Downey Jr. Is Tony Stark, and for those who have followed everything from the beginning I think you will always remember him by the name Tony or Iron Man. Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Tom Holland and all the others were also fundamental to the realization of a universe that is no longer only understood as cinema, but as a family. Thanos is one of the best antagonists in the film world, especially for his motivations. Three hours of pure show, fabulous direction, spectacular visual effects and well-told story. A spectacular closing of an even better cycle. I don't understand how many people think this film is not up to the task it was meant to perform, madness. Trust me, even if you are not lovers of Marvel or superheroes in general, this film is not only science fiction, but above all heart.\n\nThank you Marvel.\n\n. Rating: 9.9/10.", "Watching this in theaters is incomparableMaybe not the best mcu movie, but the one I find the most satisfying. Watching this in theaters for the first time was truly an experience. This is essentially 3 separate movies- a post apocalyptic drama (act 1), a time heist (act 2), and an epic (act 3). It may not hold up as well on rewatch, but there is nothing like watching this movie for the first time.", "woowThe best movie ever it's good to finaly make a movie that beat avatar", "Incredible endingThis was an incredible ending to the Avengers saga. Plenty of story and action. An emotional roller coaster at times. The Avengers franchise has been the best superhero portrayal yet.", "ExcitingExciting, entertaining, and emotionally impactful, Avengers: Endgame does whatever it takes to deliver a satisfying finale to Marvel's epic Infinity Saga", "We love you 3000!Thanos (Josh Brolin) snapped his fingers while wearing the Infinity Gauntlet, and half of all life in the universe disappeared. That's how last year's Avengers: Infinity War ended and left us craving for its epic conclusion.\n\nOne year later, we are finally in the Endgame. The Russo Brothers filmed this arc of the Marvel Cinematic Universe back to back and reminds us of the \"snap\", as we sit down to witness what's coming. Unaware of the battle happening in Wakanda, a family is in for a surprise that will have some serious consequences. Not just for them, but for the entire universe that doesn't know how to move on.\n\nThe surviving Avengers - Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Captain America (Chris Evans), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), War Machine (Don Cheadle) plus brand new members Rocket (Bradley Cooper), Okoye (Danai Gurira) and marvellous Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) set off on a mission to stop Thanos once and for all. Will they find Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) and Nebula (Karen Gillan) in time to join them on this quest? And if so, what if it all fails in the end and make things even worse?\n\n11 years and 21 films have been leading up to this chapter. Avengers: Endgame says farewell to characters that have been part of our lives for such a long time, tears are inevitable. Emotions will peak, because movie fans have sat in the backseat for such a long time and got to know these heroes as if we're part of the team. Plots will be wrapped up (even some continuity errors are being corrected, to make sure everything is correct). Everything is at stake and there is only one solution. This is it.\n\nChristopher Markus and Stephen McFeely's script knows just how to find that balance between science, drama and action. These guys know what they're doing and find the heart in the midst of all the heroism. The battle of Wakanda was just a warm up - you ain't seen nothing yet! The Avengers and all of their friends get enough screentime to be remembered with honour or to leave an everlasting mark on all of us. Our superheroes have some extra tricks up their sleeves to keep things exciting. Every one of them gets a moment to shine and the clash we witness in the third act of Endgame is one of the most perfectly constructed and visually mesmerising war scenes you will witness - maybe, EVER! There will be laughs, you will cheer and gasp and you will definitely cry.\n\nAfter Endgame, there's a whole new saga to start and an entire universe to explore. But for now, let's just enjoy the finale to our Infinity Saga and take one last bow to salute them. Thank you Avengers. We love you 3000!", "Like a lovely songPerhaps there are to many people that hate this movie, and other that love, personally, I love it, its beautiful, a gift for us, the last minutes I've smiled and cried. Obviously it's a good movie, but something is wrong, I dont know what it's but something is odd, and it taste strange, but everything have to end, right?", "A nearly perfect ending to an unprecedented movie-going journeyAvengers: End Game can't compete on its own against the likes of The Godfather, Citizen Kane, or The Dark Knight, but the Marvel Cinematic Universe has never been about competing on your own. The MCU parallels it's own characters in the sense that it's strength lies not in each individual, but rather the sum of their parts. Avengers: End Game is a thrilling and satisfying conclusion to the seemingly untouchable Infinity Saga, whose 10 year presence has changed cinema forever.", "An epic end to an epic sagaThis should be higher up the top 250! It was such a great surprise! I've never see anything like it! It was such an epic superhero movie and I loved every minute of it! It has to be one of my all time favourite superhero movie and absolutely favourite movie ever! I can't believe the outcome though! There won't be anymore avengers movies after this!", "Big, funny, entertaining and sad for those who are invested into this seriesGreetings from Lithuania.\n\n\"Avengers: Endgame\" (2019) was funny, a bit sad, very entertaining, spectacular and maybe a bit too long for me personally. I did enjoy this movie from start till finish though, and while its not my personal favorite from them all, this was a very solid movie in my opinion (and i'm not a huge fan of these movies to start with, so tears haven't been found during my watch).\n\nOverall, \"Avengers: Endgame\" brings half of the Hollywood famous actors into one big, entertaining 3 hours (!) long escapism. At the end i enjoyed this film much more then i thought i will be.", "World was waiting, and world has been servedLucky to have watched it in the very first preview, not going to be spoiling things, but people you are witnessing a conclusion of 22 Movies, you can't be fair enough while Judging, unless you have seen the efforts of 10 years of Experience in making best stories to best movies, believe that or not, if you saw the rest movies and have an idea of what every character represents you will deeply appreciate that movie, and easily say it worth 15/10, so many sacrifices, so many happiness, joy and laughter, best cinema experience among all competitors, finally gotta say, MCU rocks all the way, after a low hit in Captain Marvel, they hit back in a way to blow your mind Planet Earth, enjoy the peace of art", "A masterpieceForget people who say that this movie is crap,because the way I see it avengers endgame is the most entertaining movie in history so far.", "Avengers: Endgame - a love letter to all Marvel fans that comes straight from the heartAnd so it arrives, the culmination of nearly 11 years, 3 phases, and 21 movies, (or almost 41 hours of storytelling), Avengers: Endgame is finally upon us. And for fans that have invested their time (and money) in the Marvel Cinematic Universe over the past decade or more it is hard to see how you could be less than blown away by the epic 3 hour finale delivered by the Russo Brothers.\n\nThe fan-service paid in film 22 of an incredible cinematic arc is off the charts. Which sadly means if you are coming in to Endgame with a limited knowledge of all that has gone before then your experience of this latest MCU entry will be a much poorer one for it.\n\nThat is not to say if you are brand new to this universe you wont enjoy Endgame. There is LOTS to enjoy even if you don't know your Stormbreaker from your Mj\u00f6lnir. But it is worth investing some time to get to know the background to this closing chapter.\n\nIf you have lived through the Battle of New York, galaxy saving dance-offs, the rise of the Dark Elves, the fall of SHIELD, adventures in the quantum realm, and lack of Starbucks in Wakanda, then you are surely in for a roller coaster ride full of many emotional highs and some deeply crushing lows.\n\nIt is almost impossible for me to talk about my personal favourite moments from the film without dropping spoilers. And this is an event that you really don't want spoiled for you going in. The goosebumps, the adrenaline surges, the punches to the gut in some of the rawest MCU moments to date; no one deserves to take those feelings away from you. Aside from the beauty and majesty of many of the scenes, (not least the climatic showdown), this movie has an energy that injects directly in to the veins. With that in mind I will talk about those specific heart pounding, tear duct swelling beats another time.\n\nWhile the Russo Brothers will invariably receive all the plaudits for Infinity War and Endgame, the contribution of writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely should not be overlooked. They have crafted an incredible story over these last two instalments encapsulating everything that has gone before with near precision. While the expectation in the action stakes was always high, and boy oh boy the action does not disappoint at all, there was always the risk that sentiment would be laid on in heavy doses. Thankfully that is not the case which is a testament to the wonderful writing of Markus and McFeely. It is a script that intertwines the complexities of the story while hitting the right notes in the right spots, especially the comedy and lighter moments which are plentiful.\n\nEndgame is not without its faults, few and minor as they are. Pacing is occasionally a little off, entirely due to some over cooked exposition of major plot points. But in the grand scheme of things these are nothing more than quibbles and entirely forgivable.\n\nWhile Endgame may not be the greatest, most flawless movie ever made, it is certainly up there with the best of all the Marvel movies to date. Perhaps even among the best of the superhero genre.\n\nThere is one scene I do have to mention that annoyed me a little. Some are already referring to it as the \"girl power\" moment. While it was incredible to see all of the female MCU protagonists on screen at the same time, the moment for me felt incredibly forced! It was almost like someone at the last minute said, \"Hey, you know what will be really cool?\", and they shoehorned in this \"moment\". For me it deserved better than the after thought it felt like it was and will stand out for, perhaps, all the wrong reasons.\n\nIn summary, Endgame is the near-perfect summer popcorn blockbuster event. And if you have been as invested in the MCU journey as I have from day one it will feel so much more than that. This is a genuine love letter from Marvel to the millions that have given so much of their time and passion to these movies and the eclectic stories and characters that have developed and entertained us over the past decade. From the opening moments it crescendos its way through your soul leaving you elated, exhilarated, and positively enthralled. And in the final minutes, with the gentlest of kisses and tenderest of goodbyes, you will be left with crushing sadness yet a feeling of contentment and satisfaction ... a very real closure to everything.\n\nAnd if you are new to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, or just have a passing interest, do yourself a huge favour. Watch Infinity Wars, at a minimum, and then get along to see Endgame. Just make it happen ... whatever it takes.", "EndGame Over.One of the best avengers movies ever, with Thanos and all this is what all the movies have been leading to and the finale is great! The visuals are on another level. Some sad disappointing moments but that's how the story goes. You need to watch this absolutely if you are a Marvel or superhero fan!", "Great movieThis was a great movie and a proper end to the series.\n\nBesides some convoluted continuity issues, it was very well done.\n\nAnd the best part of all, minimal screen time for the newest and most widely hated Avenger of the bunch, CM.", "I LOVE YOU 3,000, MARVEL!The Russos couldn't have subverted our expectations in a better way. Simply, because they didn't give a hoot about our expectations. Instead, they gave us a a continuation of Infinity War with a most unexpected conflict. In other words, they went for the head; all we cared about are the stones.\n\nThey also proved that they understand every character in this universe better than anyone. They delved into their minds and hearts in a way fans ever hoped and fancied. They truly fleshed out our beloved avengers by showing them as more humans exactly as we felt about them at every important moment in every movie in the MCU. They convinced us that these characters really experienced these moments, and thus cared about them as much as we do. The incredible cast, who are at the top of their game, couldn't have complemented what the Russos did for their characters more perfectly.\n\nWhilst the unique storytelling of Infinity War never feels \"cinematic\", I absolutely loved it with its epic quality and how I felt that I was flipping pages of a graphic novel instead of watching a movie. The Russos used once again the same exceptional style of narration here, except that, to my surprise, it feels as \"cinematic\" as it gets! I have absolutely no clue how they have managed to do such a thing, but what I know is that this made me realize that Infinity War is flawed, especially in this aspect, way more than I thought. Everything here works twice as good as it did in Infinity War: comedy and drama. Also, this made the fast pacing don't come at the expense of the cohesiveness of the story.\n\nThe movie did make it a bit easy for itself sometimes (and we can see that in certain decisions that some character took, and a couple of things that are quite perfunctory that they could have gone deeper with), but the movie also took three thousand risks that entangled itself in what could have an endless loop of nonsensical chaos only to serve the franchise's fans, and it did as good as it gets.\n\n(9/10)", "Infinity war made fans more desparate. But rip IronmanLike every Marvel movies it has future'past experiences. Infinity war seemed more like a prequel. The perfect mixture of Avengers 1,2 and 3. And trailer says it all. \"Endgame\" as the name says it has a great ending. Thank you for the memories RDJ", "HONEST SHORT REVIEW FROM A MCU FANEndgame is too long. Why is that a problem? Because the length prevents the film from truly soaring to the heights achieved by Infinity War. I love the MCU and was as geeked out as anyone for Endgame, but I have to be honest. So here we go.....\n\nThe movie is largely built around the original 6 Avengers and that's fine to set up the film, however, Endgame takes a VERY long time to get any real momentum. A VERY long time. It isn't until Ant Man arrives that any life is injected into the film. So here are a few let downs in my opinion...\n\n1. Captain Marvel is little more than a cardboard cutout and the personality she expressed in her movie is nowhere to be found. 2. You will be very disappointed if you enjoy seeing \"Hulk Smash!\" 3. You will be very disappointed if you hope to see much of Black Panther, Loki, Bucky, Nick Fury, Groot, or Gomorrah. 4. The film rarely lets loose the personalities we've all come to enjoy in Rocket, Star Lord, Happy, or even Captain Marvel for that matter.\n\nNow for some positives:\n\n1. There are some very good laughs that thankfully lift up the long run time. 2. Its a blast revisiting some moments from past MCU films. 3. It's nice to see the female empowerment themes and the potential set up for the Young Avengers 4. You can go to the restroom without missing something truly crucial. Seriously.\n\nOverall: Endgame is 30 minutes too long and this prevents the film from achieving a solid and consistent pace. It allows moments where we have to think about the \"science\" behind the action. The emotional highs and lows are simply not as impactful as Infinity War and some serious stuff happens in Endgame. The climax is enjoyable, however we have waited over 2 hours to see if our favorite characters from the extended MCU are going to appear and by this time the climax has to be compressed into a 45 minute \"epic\" battle that is barely on par with the battle of Infinity War.\n\nIn short, Endgame is inferior to Infinity War. I should have felt deep sadness at times throughout the film and the movie was unable to create that feeling in me. I wanted to feel the same highs I felt with Infinity War, but those highs were few and fleeting.\n\nIt wraps the Avengers MCU in a beautiful box, but when opened, I was underwhelmed. I got my money's worth in sheer length, but that running time was detrimental to my ability to deeply invest.\n\nSean", "Amazing watch!!This isn't so much a movie as an experience. And the homework needed to fully appreciate this is daunting for the most dedicated fans. But the pay-off for sticking with the MCU for 11 years and 22 movies is nothing short of spectacular. So many shocking developments, awesome moments and tear jerking scenes that even the most critical, cynical moviegoers will just be beaten into thoroughly enjoying this movie. There will never be another cinematic moment like this.", "AVENGERS' FANS ASSEMBLE! - Isn't this why we go to the movies for?!My Rating : 9/10\n\nThis is exactly why people go to sit in a dark room with bright lights bouncing back into their retinas for pleasure!\n\nNow on to the movie - 'Avengers : Endgame' is a finale of sorts of the Marvel Avengers Franchise which started back in 2008 with Jon Favreau's brilliant 'Iron Man' and we are already 21 movies in after 11 glorious action-packed years!\n\n'Avengers : Endgame' is emotional, super funny and lots of little throwbacks to the previous movies for nostalgia value will make this the most talked-about and entertaining movie of the year - There's no place for critics here, it's about the fans' love for the series given justice. If you go looking for plotholes or keep thinking 'well this doesn't make any sense' or 'wow that's dumb' - this isn't for you! All of the MCU movies are romanticist in nature and they are for all ages to enjoy so they can't exactly become too dark or complicated for that matter.\n\nThumbs Up to the Avengers for making it a happy fan experience (and a bit teary-eyed one)!", "A TOTAL EMOTION KNOCKOUT.A great end of an era. That's all I need to say. Not a crazy Marvel fan, but this one just got me right away.", "A film that pulled off the impossible.Avengers: Infinity War is a film that should be utter crap. A franchise stretching almost twenty films is unheard of. And making a great and satisfying climax to that franchise is nearly impossible. Considering how many characters Marvel had to juggle together with this movie, there was almost no way this movie wouldn't suck.\n\nBut it didn't. Marvel pulled it off. All of the characters were balanced seemingly effortlessly. The action was amazing. The characters were funny. The story was compelling. Marvel made what should've been an overcrowded mess into one of the best superhero films ever made.\n\nThis movie will sit you on the edge of your seat for 2 and a half hours. Hats off to the writers, directors, producers, and Marvel Studios.\n\n10/10", "Better than EndgameInfinity war is one of the best MCU protects. It has a great story, great acting, and awesome looking. If you aren't a Marvel fan or haven't watched most of the previous MCU movies this however, won't be something for you. Let's start with Thanos, definitely one of the best villains, he has a motive, is well played, you can even say that Infinity war tells his story and not the story of a hero. But also most of the other cast members were great in their role and again, if you love Marvel, watch this movie.", "Best Cliffhanger of all TimeA meticulously planned film down to the last detail, where you can see how much love is behind it. Of course, the film delivers impressive show values and action, but besides, it is above all the interactions of the characters that are well thought out. Surprisingly, no character is neglected, and all the storylines of the previous films are brought together amazingly logical. The end is for me one of the best cliffhangers of all time, after the movie I was whacked. In the end, I have to ask myself: What more do I expect from a comic book superhero film? I was perfectly happy, so I can also give a comic book adaptation 10 out of 10 stars.", "EPICInfinity war seemed much better than endgame to be honest.", "Best movie ihave ever seenInfinity war Is the best movie . I like this movie more than avengers endgame.", "Somehow they pulled this offI consider myself a big comic book marvel fan. My favorite films from the franchise so far, are Cap. American: Winter Soldier and Thor: Ragnarok. As this movie was directed by the same guys as Winter Soldier and Civil War, I went into this movie with sky-high expectations.\n\nI am gonna keep this brief: Avengers: Infinity War blew me away! If I should mention just one thing that really amazed me was the character of Thanos. He is so well developed and makes for a super interesting and complex villain. As an audience, we are actually capable of sympathizing with a guy, who wants to kill off half of the universe. It's not about power or dominance. It's about preserving life in a Universe with finite resources - a goal with leads him (and the avengers) into several interesting moral dilemmas.\n\nI agree with the other reviews here. This movie is such a beautiful calamity of 10 years of the best superhero entertainment there is. Thinking about it, I can't really grasp how the director pulled this off. So many well developed characters from different story lines are working together in a true cinematic symphony.\n\nI give this movie my highest recommendations. It's a must-see for anyone with just a remote interest in the franchise.", "The bestThis is is the best marvel/avengers movie every minute is very great no cap.", "Unlike anything ever done in the history of cinemaThis movie is the beginning of the culmination of Marvel's masterfully woven cinematic universe. Beginning back in 2008 with iron man, we are finally seeing the results of all the movies have been pointing to; and it did not disappoint. Thanos is a complex villain, with deeper and more interesting desires than just \"world domination.\" The dilemmas all the characters face in this movie (both the heroes and the villains) are truly thought provoking and leave you on the edge of your seat. No other set of movies has beeen so involved, so expanded, and encompassed so many story lines/characters and previous movies. The sheer amount of star power alone in this film is insane; and they do a masterful job of weaving all these unique and various characters into a common storyline.", "Best superhero experienceThis movie is truly once in a lifetime experience.", "Still the bestEven after endgame i still think this movie is superior.", "Much better than END GAMEAVENGERS:INFINITY WAR,to say in one line,is perfectly balanced as all things should be. It was the most anticipated movie of the decade,and it had to deliver what seemed impossible-bringing together two dozen superheroes,combining plot threads from the previous 18 films,introducing the biggest villain onscreen and perfectly balancing humor with emotions and action with drama-all in a single film-and the russos nailed it.... Mild Spoilers follows... The main attraction of the film ,is no doubt the Mad Titan. Thanos is not your usual villain. He is complex and multi-dimensional. He is cruel,ruthless,kills but at the same time, he mourns,shows compassion,and above all-he has a reason for his actions-and that's what makes him the most interesting and dangerous villain. He gets the most screen time than any other hero...It is as if he is the central character. Its as if we are following his journey of collecting the six infinity stones so that he can destroy half the universe. He wants to wipe out half of the universe,not because he sees fun in it nor he wants to rule. All he wants is to achieve balance in the universe. According to him if the universe is left unchecked,then the universe might destroy itself due to overpopulation. He wants to do this action so that the other half and the future generations can thrive....he describes it as mercy. Along with him ,the film also gave us sidekick antagonists in the form of black order. Among them,Ebony maw was cool to watch. The actions and choreography were amazing. If you thought the actions in the trailers were awesome,o boy...u aint seen nothing. The people behind the camera ..they did a fantastic job. The art work was good ...and the cgi and vfx looked realistic. They did a remarkable job in capturing all the facial expressions in josh brolins face. Nothing to say about screenplay...its just ....I cant imagine how they delivered it ..and like a star wars movie we got to see different parts of the galaxy-From the sanctum sanctorum to New avengers facility. From wakanda to New york. From Nevidilir to knowhere and from vormir to titan and finally to wakanda...The shifting of story from one scene to another scene and location without confusing the plot was executed perfectly. The dialogues were sensible..and the film is filled with lots of pretty and punchy one liners that will fill you with laughter,and some that will make you emotional. The character interactions...well this was what we wanted to see more than anything...and trust me ,the russo brothers delivered more than what we expected. Not only that, the film gives adequate time for characters to grow and develop in such a short time frame that you feel for each and every character ...its a treat for those who have followed all mcu films and had made the characters part of their life.....the interaction between these different characters is what makes this film unique.....there are reunions...there are first meetings..the plot is written as such that each and every character is vital to the story... The guardians get a lot of screen time...and Thor-guardians interactions are one of the best and most entertaining moments in the film .The trio formed by dr strange,peter parker and tony stark was also very amazing..The first meeting between earths mightiest heroes and the guardians of the galaxy is very funny ...The thanos-gamora relationship is very well explored ..the film also gives ample time to vision-scarlett witch romance that was teased in the trailers... captain america has a grand entry ..we get to see black panther...bruce banner ..o well he has his own arc in the film and is funny.. and so on... Its the darkest and most emotional movie in the franchise..as the first scene itself sets the tone for the entire film. The stakes are higher than ever and the ENDING will just make you numb ....., Its not just a superhero movie..Its a movie about love,relationship,sacrifice and above all asks a moral question- \"under what condition is it just to trade one innocent life to save others\".", "The second best movie of MarvelI love this movie, i love it.

The Avengers, who are all spread out around the universe, have to work together to stop him. Thanos is really strong and wants to bring balance to the universe in a weird way.\n\nEven though there are a lot of characters, the movie still manages to follow everyone's story and show how they're.

I think the movie is so great because it contains almost everything you could ask (action, humor, heartfelt moments, great CGI, fantastic score, ...) in a balanced way. Furthermore even if the culmination of the MCU happened in \"Endgame\" it was here that every piece of the Marvel Universe was brought together for the first time. I remember to have an astronomical hype at the time and the fact that the movie resulted to be even better than what my hype was making envisioning me is something that I highly count. But the best part of this movie is its villain, Thanos. I loved him (and still do) and he absolutely stole the show and sets up Endgame perfectly. Clearly \"Infinity War\" has its flaws and I am not here to say it is perfect like a 10/10 rating would usually mean, but for what it represented at the time and the way it was delivered I think we couldn't have asked for more.", "BEST AVENGERS MOVIEAvengers infinity war is an emotional roller coaster. Using the strength of its powerful and interesting villain, the movie successfully brings together the past 10 years of Marvel movies into a largely effective cocktail of super-heroic dramatics. Joe and Anthony Russo create a superhero movie that it's every bit the epic that it needs to be. However prepared you feel, you are not ready for Thanos. Infinity war is stunning, hilarious and heartbreaking.

It manages to bring 25+ popular characters together and tie them into a single story.\n\nAfter at least 20 movies filled with characters and storylines where the main character easily wins, and the villain gets about 25% of the screentime, this film makes you understand where Thanos is coming from. It also ties in with other events, such as New York.\n\nThe movie is structured perfectly, from Thanos' perspective, putting him on a hero's journey. He travels to different locations to collect stones from heroes we know and love. We also get to see heroes that don't usually interact, and the movie is filled with iconic moments because of this.\n\nThis film is unlike anything I've seen in the MCU, and while I love Endgame, I find myself more of an Infinity War type of person. The ending is absolutely insane-a bold and creative choice, which I think is something everyone loves about this film.

Amazing from start to finish, and how they brought all the characters to light was spectacular. Only wish it was longer. Great flick!!!", "So goodWatched all the movies again since on lockdown. Read some of the other reveiws why would you see this movie with out watching the previous ones.", "THE BEST SUPERHERO MOVIE EVER!!Engrossing, Epic, Emotional. Those are the three E's that define this movie. The latest instalment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise is at its very best, culminating ten years of marvel adventure and spectacle with the biggest and most boldest movie in the superhero genre. So let's start with Anthony and Joe Russo, the geniuses that made this beast of a movie. After announcing that they will be directing the next two Avengers movies, Marvel fans knew at once that this will be the darkest Avengers movie yet. Yes, it was very dark with more of a serious tone. More than Winter Soldier and Civil War (previous marvel movies directed by the Russo Bothers) combined but they also had what the other Avengers movies had as well, the humour and it was not at all tasteless. Nobody really cared if it was necessary or not because the humour worked along with the edgy parts of the movie. This is by far the Russo brothers best work among the Marvel movies completely raising the bar of superhero movies to it's highest. Praise to Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely for writing the amazing script (they also wrote the scripts of Captain America, The Avengers, Winter Soldier, Age of Ultron and Civil War also known to be the best marvel movies). Now, the characters and story. Practically everyone that you've seen in the previous marvel movies that aren't dead, are in this movie. Everyone had the chance to shine even if it's the smallest way possible. There were so many character arcs in this movie and none of them were cut short or boring. Every scene is in the movie was worth digesting and deciphering, along with the surprises and the twists and turns that will get audiences on the edge of their seat. Everything from character development to the pacing of the storyline, makes you jump, scream, gasp or cry. And of course, the one and only, Thanos. The villain that has been teased one too many times is finally here and he delivers. Josh Brolin officially portrays the best villain in the MCU, completely pissing on Marvel's villain problem. He brings all out on the table with everything he's got. Not only will you hate Thanos by the end of the movie, but you will understand him and maybe even feel sorry for him for a few seconds. They brought layers into him that no one has seen in a movie portrayal of a Marvel villain. They made him scary and strong at the same time vulnerable and understandable. The motivation of his doing and his character development made him the best character in the movie, making the movie all about him. I cannot tell you anymore about this movie because then I would be spoiling. All I have to say is that whether you're a marvel fan or not, and if you at least know what has been going on in the previous marvel movies, GO AND WATCH IT. It will not be a waste of your time or money. Digest this to prepare for what's to come.\n\nI may be bias once again but I just have to. I have to rate this movie 10/10.

Just wow. For a film that generates so much hype in the months running up to its release, it's incredible when it not only meets expectations, but exceeds them to the point where even more hype is garnered. There are so many words to describe Marvel's latest - emotional, epic, fun, stressful, scary, hilarious, incredible. In about 2 and a half hours you will laugh, you will cry and you will cheer. It's a phenomenal achievement, the biggest marvel of Marvel yet, and a huge round of applause is warranted to everyone involved in the film. You don't need to be a fan to love this film.\n\nIt's a very simple story without lots of twists and turns, making it very easy to follow - that is, provided you've seen all (or at least most) of the films so far. For those who have been at least casually following this monumental cinematic series, everything will make sense and the characters are already known. By letting the previous films set everything up, that allows Infinity War to pack so much more in the film and just get on with it from the word 'go'. The ever-important Infinity Stones themselves are much more than simple McGuffins - the film makes the audience care about them, Thanos visibly becoming stronger with every one he collects. It's not just as simple as Thanos collecting six stones, however. Instead this doesn't follow the usual superhero story or structure, instead being utterly unpredictable, allowing the audience no respite or way to prepare for the madness that occurs. This is a very different type of superhero film, Marvel able to break away from the mould. This is a strength of the film and they absolutely do not shy away from it. This is best seen in the ending which will go down in history, along with the likes of The Italian Job. It's a bold, brave finale - in a way I would have preferred a slightly more rounded end, but the film is too daring for that, instead setting things up for Avengers 4 perfectly (even in the post-credits scene).\n\nConsidering there are over 30 characters the audience will recognise, the directors and writers have done an excellent job of balancing the characters, all seen through the structure of the film itself. Structured more like an episode of Game of Thrones, we follow different groups of characters as the climax slowly comes to a head. One moment we'll be with Iron Man, Dr Strange and Spider-Man, the next we're journeying across the galaxy with Thor and the Guardians, and next we find ourselves with Cap, Falcon and Black Widow. No character seems particularly side-lined or unimportant and the structure allows for each and every character to make a solid contribution and get their fair share of screen-time.\n\nWhereas Age of Ultron had more of an emphasis on story rather than characters, Infinity War is the complete opposite, the characters coming together instead being the main point of the film itself. It's a relief then that, besides all characters having a fair amount of time, they are all fantastic and an absolute joy to see all together in one film, every group seeping excellent chemistry. It never feels forced or gimmicky, but instead authentic and natural to see them all team up and work together. It also emphasises how perfectly cast all the characters have been over the years, able to hold their own and interact with everyone else so brilliantly. With so many characters, a film like this shouldn't work, but incredibly it does and is all the better for it. None of the groups are ever the default boring one (unlike Frodo and Sam in Lord of the Rings), but they are all lovable characters with exciting plot lines. On top of that they're all hilarious. As ever, Drax might be the funniest; but there are jokes from Stark, Strange, Quill, Groot, Rogers, Okoye... the list is endless. In a film with so much heart and action, it's amazing they managed to fit in so much comedy. It's beginning to sound like a clich\u00e9, but this is absolutely the funniest Marvel film yet - certainly funnier than the majority of \"comedies\" that come out these days. Even the new character Eitri played by Game of Thrones' Peter Dinklage gets his share of laughs. The biggest surprise with regards to characters however is Thanos. While his cohort may be formidable yet fairly bland (with the exception of the brutally sinister and downright scary Ebony Maw, played by Tom Vaughan-Lawlor), Infinity War's central villain Thanos is an exceptional antagonist, brilliantly played by Josh Brolin. As terrifying and intimidating as the monstrous purple alien may be, there is a quiet, emotional side to him. Unlike many villains, he's not looking for power for the sake of power. There's an element of humanity to him and he genuinely believes that what he's doing is for the good of the universe. This is not an antagonist to add to the ever-growing annals of forgettable villains - Thanos is the formidable foe we needed and wanted. No longer will Loki be the best Marvel bad guy by default. Will he go down as the best superhero villain since the Joker?\n\nOf course it's not all laughs and chasing stones. As expected in a film like this there's action - lots of action. It's appropriate that the word 'war' appears in the title since this is by far the most action-packed Marvel film we've seen. Despite the nigh-on non-stop action, it never gets boring or seems like too much. With a rich plethora of characters comes a wide variety of action and fighting styles. No two characters fight in the same way and so the action always seems fresh. It's a pleasure seeing all these characters we have grown to love come together and fight with one another. The CGI and fight choreographing is incredible and the battle scenes are beautifully filmed. Definitely worthwhile being seen in IMAX!\n\nThe biggest downside is having to wait a year to find out what happens next, with no clues in the upcoming Ant-Man and the Wasp or Captain Marvel in the interim (since they're set before the events of this film). Still, if the next Avengers film is anything like Infinity War we're in for another incredible treat. With terrific character interaction, hilarious comedy, sublime action and a shocking ending that will keep you awake at night - it's all perfect. The 10 years Marvel has spent leading up to this has been absolutely worth it. A splendid and monumental achievement. All hail Marvel - but beware, Thanos will return...", "ThrillingTheres nothing that i can say about this film that hasnt already been said,a visual spectacle,yeah thats been said before,an amazing action,already been said but i would certainly recomend this film.", "Speechless!Without a doubt the most complete cinematic experience I've had since The Dark Knight in 2008, only on a much grander scale. A phenomenal acheivement by everyone involved.", "The Best MCU film; a masterpieceAvengers: Infinity War is a film so powerful and good that instead of being crushed by the weight of its expectations, it lifted them up and launched them out into space. Packed with epic, intense action, fantastic character work, and a powerful ending, it doesn't get much better then this. It's especially remarkable when you remember just how much buildup there was to this film and how massive the expectations were, you would think it would be almost impossible to meet, but Infinity War does it so well it makes it look easy.\n\nThe story is exhilarating, it moves at a brisk pace which really makes you feel the immense stakes and how urgent the situation is. Every single character is handled extremely well and are all in character. The film makes sure to pay attention to what spot they're in in their character journey since the last film each respective character was in and continues their development. It maintains continuity and brings every character together in a way that's organic and serves the story perfectly. Tony Stark finally gets to fight the thing he has been tormented by and preparing for years to fight, Steve Rogers and most of the other Avengers are fugitives of the law and thus are more rugged, Bruce Banner is still dealing with his conflict with the Hulk (continuing what was established Thor: Ragnarok), Thor is dealing with the grief of losing everything, manifesting in personal vengeance towards Thanos, and much more. But perhaps the best thing about the film is the characterization of Thanos, one of the best villains in cinema since Darth Vader from Star Wars (which was the intent of the Russos, specifically saying that the wanted to make \"the next Darth Vader\"). He is a ruthless, insane and narcissistic monster, but he still has honorable traits, respects his enemies, he has a very flawed perspective of how to save the universe but believes it whole-heartedly, and even a fatherly love towards Gamora. He's terrifying but also humanized, and it just works perfectly.\n\nThe computer generated effects, especially those that brought Thanos to life, are perfect, as is the soundtrack. While MCU scores are typically regarded as forgettable, Alan Silvestri's score for Infinity War is anything but. The performances are impeccable as well, there's not a single unsatisfying or uneven performance. Josh Brolin as Thanos, Robert Downey Jr. As Tony Stark, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Chris Evans as Steve Rogers, Chris Pratt as Peter Quill, Benedict Bumberbatch as Doctor Strange, Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda and Zoe Salanda as Gamora in particular stick out to me and knock it out of the park.\n\nIn conclusion, Infinity War is the best MCU film and one of the best films to have come out in the past 10 years, and I don't think you could ask for more. Infinity War (along with its sequel, Avengers: Endgame) isn't just a movie, it's an experience.", "Marvel is the bestThere's no way anyone will be able to beat the Avengers franchise.

My friend was still mourning the character deaths, so I took her home, bought another ticket and went straight back to that theater. This movie is marvelous. Not only am I a hardcore Marvel fan, but I am also a film student and a writer. I absolutely admire and give my applaud to Marvel, for having the patience, the courage, the directors, the producers, the cast, and the crew spending a decade turning 70 years worth of comics into this beloved franchise that brought those stories and characters to life.\n\nI'm going to do my best to keep this short and sweet, without spoilers. This movie should be getting nothing but appreciation and praise. This movie is for the fans, not trolls, not critics. The Russo brothers did exceptional, balancing each character perfectly to their own spotlight. Nothing felt over done or unnecessary, every moment was completely motivated and executed beautifully. The character pairings were well thought out, mended well, the character growth and interactions were fun, and I nearly lost it from excitement. Any scene with Thanos was amazing and stressful, his character arc was well developed and almost made me feel for his gentle side, but whenever he walked on screen I was scared for the heroes lives!! The actors, as always, were incredible, but their performances in Infinity War were outstanding, they all deserve Oscars. Despite the few heartwarming jokes and banter, the movie never shifted from it's serious tone, which I appreciate, as the actors held strong emotional moments that will undoubtedly leave you teary-eyed and heartbroken. This movie will leave you laughing, it will leave you shocked by the twists and turns, it will possibly leave you gasping horrified (like me) or screaming (like some fans), and the ending will leave you emotionally crippled by the cliffhanger, but you will be awestruck.\n\nThe only thing that I wish was a little different was I wish the score was a little less dramatic and more softer and powerful to deliver that emotion further. I wish they got Hans Zimmer to score the Avengers, but I'm not removing a star for that, because all in all Avengers: Infinity War is a masterpiece, and it takes a lot for me to called a movie a masterpiece, even if its Marvel, but Infinity War pasted all expectations. Do not miss this experience. It is satisfying in all ways and never disappointed me. Now go buy that ticket and enjoy this unique, special, and phenomenal film!", "Better one from marvel\"Avengers: Infinity War\" is a monumental culmination of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

Each character gets at least one great moment or memorable line, they perfectly mesh all of the different tones established in the respective universes, and Thanos is an iconic villain that was truly given the respect he deserved. This movie has quite a bit of humor, but pretty much all of it worked very well to me. Normally when a marvel movie gets this long, it starts to get boring or it heavily drags during some points, but this movie is constantly moving towards the climax and really keeps you invested. I was so surprised by this, as I saw it with all of my high school buddies without many expectations of it. While Endgame will be remembered as the iconic end of the franchise, this will always be my favorite because of the attention given to each of its characters, and the excellent ending that subverts expectations and perfectly sets up our characters for the finale they needed.", "Ok, fellow fans. Here we are.After 10 years of buildup and hype surrounding every movie that came out, We are finally here. The big showdown we've been waiting for since 2008. I, unfortunately, didn't get to see this in the theaters, but I got it the day it came out on Blu-Ray and watched it with some friends and fellow fans of the MCU. And.... Wow. In a good way. This knocked my socks off. This wasn't Joss Whedon like the first two (I might be wrong), but this was just as visually stunning and had the same effect. The end was a punch to the gut. A hard one. Anyway, the beginning was unlike any Marvel movie I'd ever seen. Thanos torturing Thor and killing Loki made lots of sense, since they had just seen Thanos's ship at the end of Thor: Ragnarok, and it was brutal to watch, and really made you hate Thanos right from the start.\n\nThe middle was just as good, with some lighthearted moments like the Guardians' entrance (my personal favorite after Thor's to Wakanda) and some funny scenes with the Guardians (\"Are you mocking me?\") and the action scenes in New York with some banter involved with Spiderman. The part where Thor forges Stormbreaker was one of the most epic scenes in the whole MCU, and we finally got to see Groot do something other than play his game, which was needed.\n\nThor's entrance to Wakanda, though... It's indescribable. I got chills then and I get chills just thinking of it now. Remember, the other Avengers (Cap, Black Widow, etc.) hadn't seen him in 2+ years, and he looked AWESOME (as always).\n\nThanos, the villain, is my second favorite after Killmonger (Black Panther). He thought he was doing the right thing by trying to wipe out half the universe, and as much as we hated him, we sympathized with him. He was a great villain with really realistic motives, and the CGI, OH, MAN. Was it stunning. Every scene felt realistic, and I felt the power in every move and every blast that a character took. None of it felt fake\n\nOverall!!", "AwesomeThis Movie Was Literally Amazing Just No Words Mind Blowing Action And Next Level Story Just Watch This Movie.

The performances are stellar, especially Josh Brolin as Thanos, who adds depth to the villain's motivations. The film's bold, emotional ending, which leaves audiences in shock, sets the stage for an epic conclusion in *Endgame*. *Infinity War* delivers an unforgettable experience, pushing the MCU into new territory and raising the bar for superhero storytelling.", "Amazing!The deaths. I sent out a tweet right after I got out of the theatre saying that my one-word review of this film is, 'ambitious' and that's because of the outcome of many of this film's main characters. At the end of the film, we see Thanos complete his mission of collecting all of the Infinity Stones, with the sacrifice of his own daughter and Guardian of the Galaxy, Gamora.\n\nIn my favorite scene of the film, Thor sinks his new ax deep into Thanos' chest, and Thanos says through a wicked grin, \"You should have went for the head,\" and he snaps his fingers, just like in the original source material and destroys half of all life in the universe. Moments later some of our favorite heroes start reducing to dust and every single person in my theatre was stunned.\n\nThere was a moment when fan favorite, Black Panther started reducing to dust and a person in the theatre audibly yelled out, cursing at the screen. This sequence which had no music behind it was extremely eerie and shocking in a beautifully vindictive way.\n\nA lot of our favorite heroes were just straight up dying and the movie ends on that cliffhanger. I called it ambitious because we don't know if any of these characters like Spiderman, Black Panther, Scarlet Witch and many others are ever gonna come back. I mean they will be revived because Spiderman and Black Panther made like 2 billion dollars and are both scheduled for second movies, but right now they are dead. Our heroes lost and that's never happened before.\n\nEven though this is called 'Avengers: Infinity War', this is Thanos' movie at its core. Marvel has been building Thanos for ten years and in this movie, he cemented himself as the greatest villain in the MCU, which has had villain problems in previous films. Josh Brolin, who voices and did the motion capture for Thanos brings an entirely new personality to the character from what comic fans are used to.", "MCU does it againAn American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team the Avengers.

There is also tension because you want to know what happens and who will survive the story. the film is well filmed and the action is well captured. the special effects are impressive and the music by Alan Silvestri is very good. the movie is well acted and especially thanos played by Josh Brolin is well played.

The ultimate penultimate and better the 2nd time around", "The Oscars need a new category for CGI actorsFor some reason, the Oscar voters will never vote for a CGI actor because \"it's computer generated'\". That's BS. The character is brought to life by a real actor, and if the acting is flat, so is the character, regardless of how good the CGI is. Josh Brolin deserved at least a nomination, if not the statue itself. This movie was about Thanos, and Brolin brought the character to life, showing that he was a man, but had a vision that would not be denied. The CGI was just adequate to keep up; it was the actor that made the character real. I was almost rooting for Thanos by the end. Almost. Chris Hemsworth and ZoeSaldena also both pulled out magnificent performances, but this was Thanos's movie.

I've watched this film three times now so I can get a true picture of it and honestly I enjoyed it more, the more I watched it. To juggle a huge cast this size and make it work is an accomplishment, and boy is this an accomplishment.\n\nEach character shines in their own way and the comedy is placed well, so not to take away the depth, the pain, the suffering and severity off this story arc. The SFX is some of the best ever seen in my opinion, yes there are some slight flaws here and there, but not enough to take your mind of the story on screen. Thanos looks amazing and for the true comic fans like myself Kevin Feige, the Russo brothers and the team at Marvel Studios have excelled in bringing the dark Titan from page to screen.\n\nJosh Brolin is totally worthy of playing this nemesis and Brolin adds heart, pain, power and a sadness to this character, as always the Marvel team hits a home run with the casting. Every little detail is put into Thanos. For a purple giant he looks realistic, from an eyebrow movement or a cheek twitch to a full on capable gladiator in battle stance, he looks like a living, breathing being.\n\nWhere does this film stand against the rest of the MCU, well it's right up there in the top three. Some people might not like or even fully understand the ending, but the possibilities it sets up for the future of the MCU only leaves me with questions and excitement!

For me it's the peak of the superhero genre alongside with Endgame.\n\nSo now were in the Endgame...", "Superhero odysseyA tape of incomparable magnitudes. An unprecedented superhero odyssey. This seems to me the best way to describe this film, which takes the limits of the genre to a new level. In a world like today where superhero cinema dominates the market, even more so the movies from Marvel Studios, it can often be difficult to surprise. However, Infinity War not only creates this emotion inherent in a movie of these characteristics, but it brings together the best that Marvel has built over ten years and mixes it in an organic as well as frantic and impressive way every second. It is a film that is practically constant action, like many of the genre, but with a speech and an emotional weight greater than that seen on other occasions. A special care is appreciated in forming a convincing story with enough dramatic and sentimental value, at the same time that the narrative action does not stop. 'Avengers Infinity War' is first and foremost a superhero movie that embraces the genre and exploits it to the fullest. A film with great ambitions that is capable of surpassing itself, resulting in one of the best films in the studio and in the genre itself.", "IncredibleBest marvel movie yet, so much action and sadness at the same time. Can't wait for the 4th avengers", "What did we expect?The hype for Avengers Infinity War was truly real. The expectations were to the roof with this one, but I'm afraid we all did a huge mistake on what to expect. Can a 150 minute movie deliver on the level of these expectations and hype? Well it can't, but this movie does it's best.This film is completely different than any other MCU film, and any other film in general, and you will find that out when you see it for yourself. You must be happy to see your favourite character even for 5 minutes in this movie, that's one of the necessary cons of the mix, and we shouldn't expected more in the first place.The movie lacks basic plot development. That'sFORTUNATELY not a very bad thing in the end of the day. In general, the movie delivers what a 150 minute movie with 20+ main cast can deliver. The consequences were unexpected, and shocking, and the Russo brother did their best. I'm sure if you go to see he movie with low expectations you will enjoy it a hell more. 9.5/10 After rewatching this movie I will change my vote from 8 to 9.5.\n\n*It's impossible for this title to remain at 9.5/10, and do not trust this number. Batman v Superman started at 9.8 as well, and we know where it ended up. Really, I think most of the fans will like it A LOT, but the score will drop A LOT once the movie opens in the US and China. Most of the votes now, come from people who have not even seen the movie yet.", "One to WatchFirst off the movie was great from begining to the end . A roller coaster ride of adventure I enjoyed it every minute and went out the theaters wanting to see more. So expect me to go see it again before it end its run.! No super hero movie has ever come close to what people at Marvel are doing at the moment. And Avengers Infinity War said that furthermore this movie soared through my expectations. The visual was spectacular the action was explosive and satisfying. The Russo's have crafted Something truly remarkable and freshness that you'd never expect. The ending of this film truly opens up an intriguing narrative possibilities that strech in any direction. On the strength of this outing, that's Something to be anticipated, rather than feared.\n\nI highly recomend everyone to go see it", "Marvel dissapointed me so much :(After 2 outstanding Avengers movies comes this one.

Introspective and quite Andy (Tim Robbins) gradually befriends inmates and over the next 2 decades wins the trust of prisoners and wardens but in his heart he still yearns for freedom . There he forms a peculiar friendship with Red (Morgan Freeman), the prison fixer , he experiences the brutality of prison life with a sadistic head guard (Clancy Brown), and is also mistreated and raped ; however , he adapts himself and offers financial advice to the guards and the selfish governor (Bob Gunton) , all in a shot 19 years. As two imprisoned men bond over a number of years, finding peace and redemption through acts of common help , friendship and decency . But when the proof of Andy's innocence is ripped away by those who need his services ,we learn that all is not quite what it seems at this State Penitentary , provoking a few susprises in the last two reels .\n\nThis is a very good and serious prison movie with thrills , emotion , exciting scenes , colour-blind relationships , hardnut camaraderie , gang opression , and violent disavowal of any homosexual implications . Prison buffs will find a lot of incidents to relish and the great spiritual resolution takes some swallowing and unexpected surprises . Adapted from the novella \u00a8Rita Hayworth and Shawshank redemption\u00a8 ; the twist here is the upright starring is exceptionally bright , as his ability with accountancy leads to his handling the finances of everyone , from the humblest guard to the prison boss . Wonderful spectacle in watching time-passer while changing the bombshell actresses of the history : Rita Hayworth , Marilyn Monroe , Raquel Welch . US prison films have been making solid fares for more than sixty years and apart from slowness of pace in the second half , this one is well up to prison standards . This Frank Darabont's theatrical debut turns out to be a throwback rendition to the kind of literate , thought-provoking prison drama Hollywood used to make , such as : I am a fugitive from a chain gang , Birdman of Alcatraz and Escape from Alcatraz .\n\nTim Robbins plays magnificently Andy , an inmate finding solace and eventual redemption , Tim provides his usual talent for playing ambiguous roles , as his notable skills are put to good use. Along with Robbins' best screen acting there are various Oscar-worthy supporting characters with special mention for Morgan Freeman as the good fixer who brings his ordinary grace to what could have been a thankless role , the veteran James Withmore as the crow-keeping librarian , the sympathetic newcomer inmate Gil Bellows ,William Sadler , Mark Rolston and the ruthless guardian Clancy Brown and , of course , the egoistic and nasty governor excellently played by Bob Gunton .\n\nIt contains a colorful and evocative cinematography by Roger Deakins . And an enjoyable and really feeling musical score by Thomas Newman . In his engrossing direction debut ,Darabont avoids boring by fleeing most prison movie cliches . It results to be a pleasure of discovering a first-time filmmaker with evident respect for the intelligence of his audience , giving sensitive scenes , and brave enough to let roles details accumulate without recourse the excessively maudlin and over-sentimentality. It is a true masterpiece , being marvelously acted and perfectly paced.", "One of the Best If You Get ItPeople look for all sorts of things in movies, and you can see it in the occasional negative review that pops up for this movie. Some viewers are looking for gritty realism in everything on the screen. Others are action junkies. Still others perhaps take film too seriously and reduce moviemaking to nothing more than a game of who can come up with the edgiest shot, or the niftiest angle. For all of these, there is the very real chance that they simply will not \"get\" this film, and that's too bad -- they are missing out on a classic.\n\nAt its best, film can transcend merely being a series of pictures, no matter how pretty, and can reach down and touch people. That is where Shawshank succeeds so brilliantly. It is not the fastest moving movie, not the edgiest, not the grittiest, it is filmed in shades of gray. But this movie absolutely sings with human spirit, and captures an universal human theme as well as any movie has ever done. And THAT is filmmaking at its finest. Not a game, not eye candy -- this movie stays with you long after the credits have rolled.", "The Shawshank RedemptionThe classic can be recalled repeatedly. Andy is full of yearning for life and freedom. To get out of prison is a new life for him; and red, who has been used to prison life, has become numb. To get out of prison is death for him.", "10 out of 10Don't want to say any words about this film. Just a perfect 10.", "A Sort of Secular RedemptionThe story of this film takes place over a twenty-year period between 1947 and 1967. Andy Dufresne, a young banker from Portland, Maine, is wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, and sentenced to life imprisonment. (\"Shawshank\" is the name of the prison where he serves his sentence). The prison is a brutal place, and Andy is frequently beaten and sexually assaulted by a gang of homosexual inmates called \"The Sisters\". Two things, however, help him to survive. One is his friendship with another convict, Red, who has a reputation for being able to acquire almost any item and, for a price, to smuggle it into the prison. The other is his financial expertise, which he puts to good use, becoming a tax and financial adviser to the prison guards and even the Warden himself. As a reward for these services, Andy is given a privileged job in the prison library and protection from molestation. To avenge their attacks on Andy, the leader of the \"Sisters\" is so badly beaten by the guards that he is crippled for life; Andy is not molested again.\n\nThe Warden devises a scheme under which inmates are put to work on local construction projects. The purpose of this is ostensibly to prepare them for life after they are released, but in reality he is exploiting their free labour for his own personal profit, and using Andy's financial skills to launder the proceeds. This arrangement seems to work to Andy's advantage, because of the extra privileges he is granted, but things change when a new young prisoner named Tommy Williams is sent to Shawshank. Tommy has evidence that could secure Andy's release; a former cellmate in another prison has confessed to him that he committed the murders for which Andy was convicted. Tommy confides this secret to the Warden who, fearing that his illegal schemes will be revealed should Andy ever be released, arranges to have Tommy murdered by a corrupt guard.\n\nThere is a long history of American prison films, including the likes of \"I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang\", \"Cool Hand Luke\", \"Brubaker\" and the more recent \"The Last Castle\". (Frank Darabont was later to direct another prison film, \"The Green Mile\", based, like \"The Shawshank Redemption\" on a Stephen King story). Most of these were made with a liberal social agenda in mind, aiming to expose the harsh prison conditions and thereby inspire their reform. \"The Shawshank Redemption\" falls, to some extent, within this tradition; it is made from a basically liberal viewpoint and vividly depicts the brutality of prison life, although the fact that it is a period piece, set several decades in the past, might suggest that social issues were not the filmmakers' sole concern. Perhaps more important are the analysis of the nature of freedom and of the relationship between Andy and Red.\n\nThe word \"prison\", from the French \"pris\" (\"taken\"), merely indicates a place where captives are held, and the authorities, especially in America, prefer to describe many prisons by some more positive term such as \"penitentiary\" or \"reformatory\" which implies their purpose of rehabilitating criminals. Shawshank, a prison where the Warden and guards are at least as crooked as the inmates, has precisely the opposite effect. Andy goes in innocent of any crime and comes out guilty of being an accessory to corruption and fraud. Yet, despite his involvement in the Warden's dishonesty, Andy retains a certain integrity; he refuses to give up hope and refuses to allow himself to be beaten by the system. Although he is in prison he has found a sort of freedom. A key moment comes when he defies the guards to play a Mozart aria over the prison loudspeakers for all the inmates to hear- a reminder of spiritual values even in the harshest of environments.\n\nRed faces a different problem. He fears that he has become so institutionalised that he will be unable to survive freedom, as happened to another long-term prisoner who committed suicide shortly after his release. In prison, his role as the \"fixer\" who can obtain anything, be it a packet of cigarettes, a rock hammer or a poster of Rita Hayworth, makes him the king of the inmates. (These latter two items will play an important role in the plot). On the outside he will be just another ex-con trying to make ends meet in a dead-end job. Paradoxically, he is more free in jail than he will be on the outside. I won't give away the ending, but it involves Andy repaying Red's previous kindnesses by showing him how he can be free in all senses of the word.\n\nThe film was not a great box office success when first released but has since acquired a status as one of the classics of the modern American cinema; it has now supplanted \"The Godfather\" as number one on IMDb's Top 250 list. The film would perhaps not be number one on my personal list, but it is a fine one and would certainly be in my top 250, perhaps the top 100. Its two stars, Tim Robbins as Andy and Morgan Freeman as Red, are both excellent. Its initial lack of success may have had something to do with its rather clumsy title. \"Shawshank\" is not a word that will mean anything to the average person (according to one story Darabont was once asked how his \"rickshaw\" film was going) and \"redemption\", except in technical legal contexts, normally has a religious connotation. This is not an explicitly religious film; indeed, in its portrayal of Warden Norton as a sanctimonious, Bible-bashing hypocrite, it can be seen as critical of religion. Nevertheless, the word \"redemption\" is perhaps appropriate in this context, after undergoing the hell of Shawshank Andy and Red manage to find a sort of secular redemption. It may be this message of hope that accounts for the film's continuing popularity. 9/10", "Now here is a classicThis suspense filled, dramatic movie rides high on the plain of self discovery, self worth and self preservation; if an innocent man is locked up for two decades with criminals, nothing else will he learn than to be a criminal himself. There is no better movie that I can recommend you to see than this classic Jail Break that stared one of the best supporting actors you will love to have on your side if you are in the lead role of a movie, Morgan Freeman.\n\nShawshank Redemption was adapted from a Stephen King novella named Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Frank Darabont secured the right to make the film from King in 1987, and he worked intensively on the screenplay for a proper adaptation of the movie, Darabont's screenplay writing earned him an Academy Award nomination, in fact the movie had seven Academy Award nominations and won none.\n\nThe film tells the story of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who is a banker who got convicted for murdering his wife and her lover; he got two consecutive life sentences at Shawshank State Penitentiary. At Shawshank Andy befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman) Red was a contraband smuggler.\n\nAndy also developed a nice rapport with the warden and the other guards helping them with their taxes and also helping the warden in his money laundering operation.\n\nThe movie boast of amazing scenery not to add an impressive cinematography, the movie growth and inclusion and exit of characters will make you feel like you are reading a book, the movie has numerous cast, and it is broken into segments each introducing new casts and each building a parallel wall that guides us to the climatic end.\n\nIt didn't do well in the box office at all barely making back its production cost, but due to critic's high rating and Academy Award nomination, Golden Globe award nomination and other notable nominations, the movie did well in rental and DVD sales, it is shown regularly on Cable TV, and it has a high following.\n\nFrank Darabont who is the director and screenplay writer also made more of King's books; He directed the 1999 Tom Hanks movie The Green Mile which was a box office success compared to this. The Green Mile is another of King's books that is about a prison, and Darabont also directed the 2007 movie The Mist which is also based on a Stephen King book.\n\nHere is a DVD every home should have.\n\nwww.lagsreviews.com", "A bit overrated, but still an amazing filmIt's times like these that almost tempt me to grab Jigsaw off the shelf. It's been almost a month since I saw a film that was flatout bad; the worst review I've given in weeks was a 6/10 to Flightplan. This film obviously didn't break my streak.\n\nI went into it knowing next to nothing, only that IMDb has it ranked as the second best movie of all time, that it was based on a story by Stephen King, and that it took place in a prison. Needless to say, it blew me away. I wont say a thing about the plot, just so that others who've yet to see this film have a chance at the same experience as me. I will say this though: It has some of the most subtle and unexpected twists you will ever see. One in particular stands out above the rest.\n\nNot much can be said about the actors that hasn't been said. Morgan Freeman gives one of the best performances of his career, and even though I've only seen 2 or 3 other Tim Robbins movies, I'm sure the same can be said for him.\n\nThough I don't agree with the multitudes of people that call this the best movie ever made, it was still a very good, very well made, very entertaining and almost heartbreaking film.\n\n9/10", "Really good adapted screenplay but that's not enough to being the top rated movie of all time.Storyline is really good so it's a story from Stephen King's book, how can be bad?

That makes it doesn't matter your age or gender or what genre you like, you'll like this movie. Yes, it can be your favorite movie but objectively I won't trust your opinion on movies that much.\n\nThe movie has really good acting and screenplay and these are the most important things in a movie. Also Costume Design and Set Decoration is really good. But this movie average quality of Cinematography, Scores and Sound Effects. Okey maybe that scores or cinematography is not bad but we are talking about the top rated movie of all time. The Green Mile is directed by same person, Frank Darabont.

The acting is superb from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, as always. The script was amazing, along with the directing. The film is one of the best films ever made due to how original it is. And the reason it is original is because it is a prison film with heart. It makes you care about criminals. The score is also very good.\n\nIt's an enthralling piece of cinema and just... Amazing. I'd recommend this film to anyone due to everyone relating to it. People like films were you are sympathetic towards a criminal, just look at A Clockwork Orange.", "One of the best - of all time. Seriously.If there was such a thing as a perfect movie, this is it. Of course, for practical reasons, one cannot award a film ten stars out of ten, because of the endless stream of new work demanding scrutiny. I'd like also to start by quoting another well known film, which sums up my opinion nicely. 'In many ways, the work of a critic is easy- we risk very little, and thrive on negative criticism, which is amusing to write and to read. But the harsh truth of the matter is that the average piece of junk is probably more valuable than our criticism designating it so'. This could not be closer to the truth. When it comes down to the wire, critics risk everything in dishing out praise, for fear of being ridiculed themselves.\n\nThere can be no such danger with The Shawshank Redemption. It is an eternal masterpiece, timeless and inspiring. I avoid being clich\u00e9d, when it is at all possible to do so, but The Shawshank Redemption is beautiful, masterfully acted, with just that right amount of tenderness. This is a tale of moral courage, and the everlasting fight for justice. As with other films of the genre, one can tell what will happen, of course, but when you watch this film, you will time and again be genuinely surprised, and maybe even shed a tear for the persistence and unquenchable thirst of the human spirit. One leaps for joy after watching this incredible film, at the knowledge that evil, in all senses of the word, can, and will never triumph.\n\nTurning an eye to the technical side of things, just for a moment, I can discern not one single badly executed shot. The Shawshank Redemption is well written, and, as I have said before, brilliantly acted. Characters that could be flat are all allowed to develop and flourish, and the film is even better for it. The film grabs our attention, right from the word go, with agitated shots of Andy looking like he IS going to kill his wife. And the soundtrack. Well, there isn't much to say; except that most of the music in this film is some of the most beautiful I have ever heard.\n\nThis is a deeply satisfying, wonderful, brilliant, fantastic, soulful cinematic work. Watch it, if you haven't seen it, and if you have, you must agree that this excellent film will be an eternal classic. There are, of course, films that people will prefer, I myself am strongly attracted to Subway, a 1985 film by Luc Besson, but for pure facial and objective value, cinema does not get much better than this.", "Superb prison buddy story - but sadly unimportant filmIf you simply see this as a straightforward storytelling prison film, then it is excellent (10/10) because it truly gets you involved in its main character. It is an extremely enjoyable and compelling experience with a heartfelt and well-acted buddy-story at its core. It delicately--and sometimes brutally--juxtaposes Andy Dufresne's (Tim Robbins) good-natured character with the harshness of prison life, projecting so much heart in doing so.\n\nHowever delightful as it is, The Shawshank Redemption has no allegories and no statements to make and it brought nothing new to cinema in either style or substance. It had no revolutionary ideas or approaches - it's only a very safe buddy-story. A damn good one, but still just that. So it can impossibly be a film that will be remembered or studied, because what will it be remembered for? Friendship? Huh, neat. I therefore don't think it's entirely deserving of being considered the #2 greatest film of all time on IMDb.com.\n\nBut moving on and looking past that, it is possibly one of my all-time favourite films for the feelings it leaves. Sure, it often jerks you for tears just a bit too purposely, but this is forgivable because emotion is crucial to a prison story. On top of that, it never falls prey to predictable sappiness - probably because of its content which is devoid of sentimental romance and instead fills you up with a tragic friendship. It is so well-sewn together by a feel-good narrative by Morgon Freeman that it is impossible not to enjoy this film.\n\n9/10", "When they give you life, that's what they takeOut of the fertile mind of American author Steven King, comes the incredible prison story called \"The Shawshank Redemption.\" It is the story of a young banker named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who has been falsely convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. Sent to the notorious Shawshank, Dufresne, is subjected to the standard abuses every prisoner faces. During the ensuing years however, he is further subjected to additional punishment by the \"Sisters\" who enjoy torturing what they call 'fresh fish.' Still Andy tries to survive each day of his sentence as best he can. Being extremely agile at his banking craft, he overhears Captain Byron T. Hadley (Clancy Brown) complain of his personal financial problems. This single incident allows Andy to take advantage of his dire situation and become useful once again. Over the years, he becomes friends with fellow convict Ellis \"Red\" Redding who is adroitly played by veteran actor, Morgan Freeman. When warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton) learns of Dufresnes' financial ability, he immediately takes advantage of it. This arrangement presents many financial opportunities for the brutal warden and the meticulous and patience prisoner. Both can benefit from the outcome. The warden intends to retire richer and Hope is the only benefit Andy ascribes to. Be he has he has more talent than the warden suspects. With additional characters actors like William Sadler as Heywood, Gil Bellows as Tommy, Mark Rolston as Bogs and legendary James Whitmore who lends a superior performance as Brooks Hatlen, this film is destined as a classic for the enjoyment of every audience. ****", "Graceful, intriguing Tim Robbins triumphThe Shawshank Redemption is in a league with Casablanca as a movie you can watch over and over, catching different nuances each time and bringing your own life experiences each time you watch it. Tim Robbins gives the performance of his career and this is the movie for which Morgan Freeman should have won an Oscar (a shame he had to wait for Million Dollar Baby.) There are many twists and turns and I defy anyone to watch the ending without tears running down their face. In fact, the entire last third of movie is filled with marvelous scenes. If there is any drawback to this movie, it is that it is a shade too long, meaning it's often butchered when it is shown with commercials on TV. Rent this, or better yet, buy it to get the full thrust of it. Definitely on my personal top 10.", "Perfectly written. Perfectly directed. Perfectly cast. Perfectly acted. PerfectI have seen The Shawshank Redemption twice now, the second time being about a week ago. After the first time I saw it, I gave it a perfect 10 rating on IMDb, something I do very rarely (I've given out 20 ratings of 10 out of the 600+ movies I've rated). However, after just one viewing, I felt so impacted by this film that it immediately rocketed near the top of my favorite movie list. After a second viewing, I feel even more amazed by it than I was the first time I saw it.\n\nThe movie captures your interest in the first scene and unfolds new plot points and character developments slowly at first and then more rapidly as the movie goes on. The movie runs about 130 minutes long, but it never gets boring. While it is admittedly slow paced, this only serves into its greatness. It allows the viewer to get to know the characters of Andy and Red and sympathize with them; along the way, we also get to know and grow attached to the other prisoners trapped inside Shawshank. The movie flows perfectly from one scene to the next, never feeling forced or losing your interest. The movie is mostly dialogue driven, but there are some violent scenes which help convey the brutality of prison life.\n\nFinally, the final 30 minutes are perhaps the most satisfying in any movie. I do not want to spoil the ending for those who have never seen it, but suffice to say, the final act of the movie leaves you floored. Both times that I saw it, I was rooted to my seat long after the credits rolled, just thinking about the brilliance of the ending and the entire movie as a whole. Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction are both great movies, highly entertaining. I particularly love Pulp Fiction; however, it is a travesty that The Shawshank Redemption did not win Best Picture. It was certainly the best film of the year in my opinion, arguably the best film of the decade, and perhaps one of the finest movies ever made. The even bigger tragedy, though, is that while Morgan Freeman earned an Oscar nomination for his great performance, Tim Robbins' turn as Andy Dufresne went without a nomination. Robbins carries the film, and his performance is truly one of the greatest I have ever seen.\n\nThe bottom line is that The Shawshank Redmption is a perfect movie. It takes you in from the opening scene and doesn't let you go until long after it comes to a tremendous close. Along the way, it will make you think, fear, wonder, and feel a number of other emotions. If you have not seen this movie, waste no time; go rent it today and see why this is the highest ranked film on IMDb.", "Reputation notwithstanding, this is powerful stuffYou could describe \"The Shawshank Redemption\" in a number of ways; engrossing drama, riveting character study, top-shelf prison movie. But it's nothing it not a shining example of the power of the indomitable human spirit. You root for Andy Dufresne from the very beginning as a man unfairly targeted by fate, and you want desperately for him to succeed . . . somehow. Mixed in with all of this is a well-written story about friendship, and even a little bit of revenge to sweeten the deal. As a Stephen King story, it's a classic, and a faithful screen adaptation.\n\nAnd that cast is impeccable.\n\n9/10", "A Story Of Hope & ResilenceFrank Darabont directed this superb adaptation of the Stephen King novella that stars Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne, a young banker who was wrongfully convicted for the murders of his wife and her boyfriend. Upon arrival at Shawshank prison in Maine, he keeps to himself mostly, causing no trouble, though does befriend long-time inmate \"Red' Redding(played by Morgan Freeman) who teaches him the ropes of prison life, though the unwanted attentions of degenerate inmates pushes poor Andy to the edge of despair, until his financial skills as a banker prove most useful to both the corrupt Captain of the guards(played by Clancy Brown) and corrupt warden(played by Bob Gunton) until Andy hits upon a most clever escape plan... Now legendary film that sits atop the IMDb best film list is indeed a worthy film(though not my pick!) Still, done with remarkable skill on every filmmaking level. Could be viewed as an allegory of Christianity, but is indeed an uplifting story of friendship and the human spirit. Supporting characters(except for the one played by James Whitmore) aren't that appealing, but aren't intended to be either! Perfect ending as well.", "Very best movie i ever watchThe story is described by \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the dividers of Shawshank Prison for quite a while and is its driving business visionary. He can get you whatever you require: cigarettes, confection, even a little shake pick like a beginner geologist may utilize. One day he and his kindred detainees watch the most recent busload of detainees empty, and they make wagers on who will cry amid their first night in jail, and who won't. Red wagers on a tall, slender person named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who resembles an innocent bystander.\n\nIn any case, Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he bet. Andy ends up being an amazement to everybody in Shawshank, in light of the fact that inside him is such an intense supply of assurance and quality that nothing appears to break him. Andy was a financier all things considered, and he's in for murder. He's clearly blameless, and there are a wide range of points of interest including his case, yet before long they go up against a sort of illusion; every one of that numbers inside jail is its own general public - who is solid, who is not - and the deliberate section of time.\n\nRed is likewise a lifer. Now and again, measuring the decades, he goes up before the parole board, and they measure the length of his term (20 years, 30 years) and inquire as to whether he supposes he has been restored. Goodness, most without a doubt, yes, he answers; however the fire leaves his confirmations as the years walk past, and there is the feeling that he has been standardized - that, similar to another old lifer who murders himself in the wake of being paroled, he can no longer truly imagine life all things considered.", "informationAndy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) bides his time during twenty years' imprisonment for the murder of his wife in this adaptation of a Stephen King story. And being Stephen King, the setting is once again Maine, though you'll find 'Shawshank State Prison' in Ohio. It's the forbiddingly Gothic Mansfield Reformatory, 100 Reformatory Road, Mansfield, on US Route 30, about 80 miles southwest of Cleveland.\n\nBuilt between 1886 and 1910, the reformatory remained in operation until 1990 and was scheduled for demolition when the film was made. In fact, much of the prison yard has now gone to make room for the adjacent Richland Correctional Institution, but the striking Administration Building lives on as a tourist attraction. Find it just north of downtown Mansfield, off South Olivesburg Road.", "A true masterpiece for any film-goer.'The Shawshank Redemption' is perhaps one of, if not the, perfect film. Every other \"great film\", or any film for that matter has it's pros and cons. Most motion pictures that are as well received as this have plenty going for it, very few against it. While I feel there are films out there with better pros; the pro to con ratio of 'The Shawshank Redemption' out-stands any other film film ever produced.\n\nI can't begin to describe every amazing element of this film. Obviously the performances are exquisite, the directing is exceptional and the score is extraordinary. The cinematography, in particular, struck me. Roger Deakins is a master with light and framing.\n\nI will watch this film again and again and remember it as one of the greatest films ever made. This film truly lies within the sweet spot of cinema.", "Why it's Number 1The Shawshank Redemption is a wonderful film. It is one of the best films of 1994. It is one of the better films of the 90's. It most certainly is not one of the best films of all time, and in turn, obviously not the best of all time. I respect those of you who have put it at number one. At least it's better than calling Happy Gilmore number one, but I digress.\n\nThis is addressed to anyone who wonders how in all the world this film beat The Godfather, Citizen Kane, 2001, and even Pulp Fiction for best film of all time. Each of these films is celebrated, henceforth it is also \"chic\" to bad-mouth these movies. People hear that Citizen Kane is great so often that when someone sees it and is disappointed, they take it personally. Same with Pulp Fiction, so many loved it, that when somebody didn't like it all that much, their dislike becomes hate, relative to the passion some people have for the film.\n\nAnother prime example is Titanic. Where is it? It's not here on the Top 250. Yet upon its release (and the subsequent months it was out) you almost didn't hear a single negative word about it. Not until the people who were so sick of the raves went, minds already made up to hate it. Some people are so pretentious that they despise anything mainstream. Hence, the backlash against Titanic.\n\nNow on to The Shawshank Redemption. The Shawshank Redemption is a film, like Titanic, that I have never heard one uncynical person say a bad thing about. Obviously then, its ratings will be high (well-deserved). However, also working in Shawshank's favor is the fact that it has never gone mainstream. The fact that it tanked at the box office may have been the best thing that happened to it. It never has become cool to knock Shawshank, therefore we rarely have people rating it 1 out of spite. With this lack of poor reviews, it is no wonder Shawshank shot to the top. It is a marvelous little movie, but certainly no Citizen Kane or 2001.", "Very powerfulI feel sorry for all of you , guys/girls who rated this as 1 star (awful). I really do not think you could consider this as the worst or one of the worst movies you have ever seen.\n\nMaybe it is overrated, maybe not , but STOP trying to lower its position in the Top 250. This is supposed to be a USER RATING , so if you loved it , give it a 10 , if for you it is an average movie , give it a 5.\n\nI read some comments about this one , and heard someone saying : \" ... it is a good movie, deserves 6 or 7 stars , but i gave it 1 star because I think it is very overrated ... \" That's so pathetic ...\n\nOnce again , STOP doing this and rate the movie as you liked it !", "Stands the test of timeThis film will go down in history as one of the greats!!!", "9 on a scale of 10Ok, as I give this movie a 9, it is going to be hard to be critical, but I feel as though that is the responsibility of anyone who doesn't rate a movie a 10.\n\nFirst of all, the acting was sensational - as good as I have seen in a long time. The direction was great and the script was great. And, it turned into (unexpectedly) a true buddy story.\n\nI could only criticize a couple things - one of which was NOT the length - 2:20. I found it a little troubling that most of the criminals were extremely nice guys - except for the obligatory bad guys in the shower. I also have to confess a real distaste for the homosexual overtones - especially early on. But, then what prison movie attempting to depict real life could leave that out???\n\nAlso, prison movies in the 1940's, 1950's and 1960's are not my favorite genre, however one of the advantages of prison movies are that you really don't care very much what period it takes place in. Anyway, that is just personal preference.\n\nAll in all, it deserves the praise it gets. I'm very glad I finally took the time to watch it.", "In the conversationA couple of 'bests' for this film; the best King adaptation ahead of Misery and Stand by Me, and in the conversation for one of the best films of all time.\n\nShawshank has stood the test of time since the sacrilegious Oscars debacle of 1995. Two films should have beaten Forrest and it is line ball between Pulp Fiction and Andy Dufresne's epic prison sentence.\n\nRobbins and Freeman have never been better as Andy and Red, whose non-sexual love story is the unique difference that sets the film apart from the usual prison movie cliches.\n\nIt can be hokey, too long by 30 minutes, and perhaps even a bit preachy. But it is incredibly well made, and very entertaining. 9/10.", "FreshFresh movie. Very good.

Tim Robbins gives a great performance as Andy Dufresne and Morgan Freeman is equally impressive as Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding two imprisoned men looking for redemption who bond after many years while dealing with not only the abusive corrupt prison guards but the violent fellow prisoners amongst them as well. Robbins and Freeman had good chemistry together which made their growing friendship that much more believable on the screen. The rest of the cast including Bob Gunton, Clancy Brown, William Sadler, Gil Bellows, and James Whitmore are effective as the supporting characters in their limited screen time. The pacing was a little slow at times and the running time of 142 minutes made the film feel a bit long but the rest made up for it's few flaws. Overall despite it's flaws The Shawshank Redemption is definitely a must see a movie that can't be missed. It has a compelling story, character development, drama, some humor, and exceptional performances by the cast (especially Robbins and Freeman) who make this one of the best books by Stephen King that was made into a movie. Well done. Much better than expected.", "An Amazing and Emotional Film, one of the very best.This movie has to be one of the very best films i've seen in my lifetime. I am usually not that fond of drama films but the portrayal of the characters and the amazing script made it a perfect translation from the Stephen King book. Morgan Freeman gives one of his best performances in this movie and actually makes you believe him as a jail smuggler, better than Chris Rock in the Longest Yard ever did. The cinematography is brilliant showing the sheer scale of this old decaying prison. The movie may not have received any Academy Awards (the show was stolen by Forrest Gump that year) but it still remains to be one of the best films around. If your looking for a deeper movie more than you're typical action flick, this will provide what you were looking for. Go out and rent it, heck go and buy it because you'll want to watch it time and time again.", "Excellent filmThis is one of my favourite films ever. Why? Well a lot of reasons really. But mostly because of the plot. It contains just about everything needed for a film to really work like art. The actors are superb (note: Freeman - why he didn't receive an Oscar for this one, I'll never understand). The story is great, and written by my all time favourite writer - Stephen King (Misery, Dolores Claiborne, The Shining, Carrie and more), which are all among my absolute top films. Try them out.

As a result, it came across as very sentimental and moving. In addition to that, the determination to adapt is stressed on in this movie. If you ever need reassurance on the fact that all obstacles can be overcome, this movie is exactly what you need. It portrays the clich\u00e9 \"nothing is impossible\" motto better than any movie has ever done.\n\nOther than the message of the movie, the acting was phenomenal.

Hope can set you free.'\n\nThis is the thoughtful and paradoxical tagline of the prison-drama saga entitled 'The Shawshank Redemption'.\n\nWith a runtime of 2 hours and 22 minutes, The Shawshank Redemption is truly director Frank Darabont's baby. But does it serve to be a dream come true for the viewers? The answer is a resounding yes, according to me.\n\nThough it failed miserably at the time of release it is now heralded as one of the greatest of the greatest that the medium of cinema has ever seen. It is #1 on the imdb Top 250.\n\nIt is an impressive, engrossing filmmaking masterpiece adapted from the horror prodigy Stephen King's 1982 novella 'Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption'. With Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman as its main characters, the movie offers marvelous acting although Robbins' Andy Dufresne scores low with respect to his overall energy I feel. It almost seems artificial, bland and repetitive. Serving a life sentence for murder, Red (Morgan Freeman) is a blend of cynicism and sincerity - a man with a good soul who has done a vile deed in his past. His friendship with Andy is the film's main highlight.\n\nThe inspirational, life-affirming and uplifting, old-fashioned style (the music and some of the cinematography) Hollywood production (Castle Rock Entertainment) is a combination of a prison-drama film as well as excellent character study. The film takes the-innocent-man-in-prison theme and gives it a new angle. Instead of focusing on crusades for freedom, the film ventures down a less-travelled road, concentrating on the personal cost of adapting to prison life and how some convicts, once they conform, lose the ability to survive beyond the barbed wire and iron bars of the prison cell. As one of the character puts it : \"These walls are funny. First, you hate them, then you get used to them, then you start to depend on them.\" This is the case with Brooks (excellently portrayed by James Whitmore) who is completely institutionalized and the scenes with him attempting to cope with life outside of prison represents one of the film's most moving and effective sequences.\n\nThe chiaroscuro of the entire film is incredible and of the scenes which leaves an impression on one's mind is one when Andy, after escaping from the prison, expresses his joy and freedom by looking up at the dark sky and his upward-facing hands welcoming raindrops to fall over his body.\n\nDarabont's film is a patiently-told, allegorical tale (unfolding like a long-played, sometimes painstakingly long chess game) of friendship, hope, survival, emancipation and ultimate redemption and salvation by the time of the film's finale.\n\nHowever, on the downside, following a solid two hours of thought-provoking drama, the film deflates like a punctured balloon during its overlong denouement. The all-too-predictable final twenty two minutes move a little slowly and my heart goes out to Darabont who displays a distressing need to wrap up everything into a tidy little package.\n\nAll in all, the film is undoubtedly great and only time will tell if it holds up another 25 or so years down the line. It's already been 24 years but I hope the future generations enjoy it just as much and not be put off by the pace and style of the narrative. 9/10.", "ShawshankedBeautifully narrated ane executed on many levels.

The film portrays how Andy Defresne, uses his banking knowledge to gain \"freedom\" from predatory inmates and the officers in charge of the prison. In the passage of time, he becomes hopeful and influential within the prison. This made him gain the respect of his co-inmates, especially longtime convict \"Red\" (Morgan Freeman) who became his closest ally. Andy eventually, achieves freedom by escaping.", "Great Movie!I'm the 2436th person to review this movie. I first saw this movie on TV while at a girl's house I was dating. I came in at about 30 minutes into the movie but I was truly captivated by the movie and I never forgot it. More than 15 years later I saw it on DVD uncut and I liked it even more. Some things I'd forgotten about from the last time I had seen it. But one thing I will never forget is the brutality of that lead guard, played by Clancy Brown. This was a movie that wanted me to abolish maximum security prisons! The violence, the rape the intimidation the corruption! It didn't start with Attica (See My Review Of Against The Wall) but has been in existence since America's founding.\n\nTim Robbin's character had the worst luck of anyone in the world! He was at the crime scene but did not go into the room where his wife was cheating on him. He left bullets behind and then stupidly threw his gone into the river only to not have it be discovered. Had he kept his gun the ballistics would have proved that his gun was not the murder weapon. As it stands another killer did the murder and in essence got away with the crime. This led to Andy's (Robbin's Character) being convicted for a crime he did not commit.\n\nI was amazed at the inner strength that Robbin's character Andy had. He was beaten, humiliated, raped and yet was able to still persevere without losing his mind. But that's what he had in abundance. He had a mind and he used it to outwit his enemies and friends too. In many ways his escape reminded me of the two fellows who escaped from prison a few months ago in New York. It was a tenacious desire to get one's freedom from the oppression of the Man! This is why I admired Tim Robbins and his character, Andy.\n\nRedd was portrayed so well by Morgan Freeman that the story might just as well have been about him too. I'm glad that Tom Cruise and Harrison Ford were not cast in these roles. The film would have suffered I'm sure. But I will say this, the film might have done better at the box office had the title been different. Shawshank Redemption is not really a catchy title and may have turned women and some men off entirely to seeing the film. This is what at least one writer said. Despite this I give the film Four and a Half Stars. Leonard Maltin gave it Two and a Half out of Four Stars. I disagree with that but he may have been turned off by the length of the film.\n\nThe author Robert A. Berman in his fantastic book Fade In: The Screen writing Process said something interesting. He said that he had read an article about films with bad titles. He said that almost every badly titled film did poorly at the box office. \"The Shawshank Redemption, which did okay in theatres, might have done more business with a better title. I passed on seeing The Shawshank Redemption in the theatres. The title just turned me off.\" He went on to say that he saw it on Pay-For-View and liked it while adding that a good title can make a difference in box office sales. I concur with this observation. The title of this movie is nothing to write home about. This may have explained its average showing at the box office. Despite this, don't hold back from seeing this fine film. It's a true gem!", "A Timeless ClassicThe Shawshank Redemption is a timeless classic that has consistently been ranked as one of the greatest movies of all time. The originality of the plot, well developed characters and engrossing story keeps you glued to your seat. Watching it for the first time, the initial slow pace of the movie may baffle you but it quickly transforms into a thrilling story that makes you wonder about how life can suddenly change. It was a new experience to learn about the North American prison system and the life within the walls of a correctional facility. While watching it for a second time I was engrossed by the subtle hints at every stage of the movie that built up to a spectacular ending. This is a story of injustice, friendship, bonding, struggle, patience, sorrow, happiness and ingenuity \u2013 a true emotional roller coaster that covers you with a generous splattering of brutal truth.

Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank redemption is the perfect example. With a great cast and an intriguing but not overly complex story this film has everything it needs to be a masterpiece. The actors have great chemistry together and while I don't appreciate the changes that were made, I do understand them. The director caught the feeling of the short story and created a believable experience. Some of the scenes are light hearted to an extent were you expect them to be free the next moment just to tear down this scene and show the degrading brutality of prison.", "Only title that can do this to meThe first time I saw Shawshank, I loved it and didn't want it to end. I remember that desire being surprisingly powerful, despite understanding that I had enjoyed it as much as I did while watching it. Its power surprised me because I didn't understand fully how or why I felt the way I did. On subsequent viewings, I prepared myself for the ending, for THAT feeling, which I began to examine.\n\nI would describe it as something on par with the end of a relationship, if not perfectly in scale, then certainly in context. A good relationship. One that ends too early, but does so because it must, because that is just how it is sometimes. I am always struck with a deep yearning to see more, to know and feel more, but also a comfort. That even though I didn't get everything I wanted, what I got is a damn sight good enough, and I should be grateful for that. But it aches, too. And then you realize that it's over, and you're going to wake up tomorrow, and start living your life again. But now you'll live having gone through this, with this perspective, this story in your memory.\n\nIt's small, not actually the same experience, but it's close. The same shape and color. No other film, no story, gives me this feeling. And just like in relationships, sometimes I end up watching nothing but disappointing titles, I have a moment when I ask myself why I do it. That maybe I'm wasting my time. And then I remember. And then I hope.", "Shawshank=artIn my opinion, The Shawshank Redemption is an amazing film in the whole way of action and how we learning from this movie.

On the other hand this film didn't have any awards as Academy and Golden Globe. This fact trouble me.

I's indeed very overwhelmed & enthusiastic about the movie.(you know, that much publicity takes the excitement to the extreme level) Now, talking about the movie, it is a story of a man who gets life imprisonment sentence for a crime which he didn't commit. Here it remembers me about the classical Russian novella named 'The Kreutzer Sonata' by \"Leo Tolstoy\". It seems to me a bit inspired from that. Indeed. The rest of the story line is different. It specifically a story of a man's struggle (in which he got succeed) to come out of the prison (by hook or crook, take it your own way) and proved himself innocent after the hard sufferings of 19 years imprisonment. The whole story tells about the moral to heed i.e. \"Hopes Never Die.\" I really can keep this movie on my All-time favorite movies list. It deserves so, Btw. This is some of among those movies in which I didn't check the duration even a single time. And, during the whole movie I was just sitting on the edge of my chair with wide open my eyes & my mind (off course). And, for now, with classiness of this movie in my brains & off course terrible sleep in my eyes, I'm no more in situation to write anything else. But one thing I'd make sure that very soon I'm gonna read 'Stephen King'.

There could be multiple JOKERs living in our society that could shake those around them in much bitter way than the film shows making people uncomforting people. Consider this a wake up call, a message, but first a film. A PERFECT film.", "MASTERPIECE \ud83d\ude0dJoaquin Phoenix gives a tour de force performance, fearless and stunning in its emotional depth and physicality. It's impossible to talk about this without referencing Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning performance from The Dark Knight, widely considered the definitive live-action portrayal of the Joker, so let's talk about it. The fact is, everyone is going to be stunned by what Phoenix accomplishes, because it's what many thought impossible - a portrayal that matches and potentially exceeds that of The Dark Knight's Clown Prince of Crime", "The Hype is realMost of the time movies are anticipated like this they end up falling short, way short. Joker is the first time I was more than happy with the hype. Please ignore the complaints of \"pernicious violence\" as they are embarrassing to say the least. We haven't seen a comic movie this real before. If we ever \"deserved\" a better class of criminal - Phillips and Phoenix have delivered. This is dark, Joker IS dark and you will fall in love with the villain as you should. The bad guys are always more romantic anyway.", "JUST AMAZING. How does this movie exist.Let me start off by saying if Joaquin Phoneix doesn't get his Oscar for this movie. Then the Oscars should be cancelled. Phoneix is amazing as you might've heard from every review ever! But Todd Phillips. Is at his best here. The story lines he takes and visuals are just breathtaking. The score!! Omg the Score! Every time that score came on, I felt very uncomfortable, like something horrible was about to happen. It was GREAT. The Inspirations from Taxi Driver and King of Comedy are there, and add so much for the movie. And I got to be honest. There are scenes that are very violent. And its disturbing. But I honestly expected it to be WAYYYY more violent from all the controversy going on. Overall this movie was GREAT. Come Oscar season, it needs to be nominated for Best Picture, ScreenPlay, Cinematography, Actor, Score and Director", "Went for a second time to watchI get why some people hate this . It's because of the political message and how some people think that you need get empathy for Arthur's madness. But come on that is not the point and it will never be. Enjoy this masterpiece because Joaquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips overdid themselves with this movie . The acting,music and cinematography are just amazing ! Please enjoy the movie without overthinking it.", "A psychological study, rather than a superhero flickI have seen Joker yesterday at Venice an early ill-fated screening. We had some trouble with audio that lead to a near-hour delay, but it definitely was worth it.\n\nJoker deserved to be presented at Venice Film Festival, an event that regards cinema as a form of art, because this film is far from a blockbuster or a mere entertainer movie, as most films in the genre are.\n\nIt focuses on the psyche of the main character, as it slowly crumbles under the pressure of society. And thus, Joaquin Phoenix does a wonderful performance, earning almost surely a nomination at the oscars at least. It's a take on the Joker that differs from Ledger's, but I'd say that both are equally as good. The main difference might be that Ledger's joker is a rational that acts insane, while Phoenix's is insane to the root.\n\nDespite being a movie about a superhero villain, Joker is much superior to most of the movies of the genre (I'd exclude the Dark Knight Trilogy only, but Joker is easily as good as Nolan's movies, or at least very close). It is a small-scaled film, with a distinct style and cinematography (that cannot but be appreciated) and a set of very cinephile references that however do not feel too forced or overly opressive. (most notable are the similarities to Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' and his 'The King of Comedy', but also Chaplin's 'Modern Times' is somewhat referenced).\n\nI am eager to see more non-comedic efforts by Todd Phillips. This movie was so far probably the best of 2019 (at worst contested so far only by Dolor Y Gloria or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), and that should be very convincing.", "Joaquin 'OSCAR', Joker = best Dark suspense thriller ... Darker than dark Knight.It's sad that Joaquin missed Oscar for 'The gladiator' as he was very compelling Villain. But I am quite confident he will win it for the 'Joker'. Damn what a movie !!! Keeps u on the toes all the time. Unpredictable storyline and really a deep interesting plot. Did I forget to mention acting ? Damn Do niro and Joaquin teach u what really is 5 star acting. To enjoy this movie, get a wine in your hand, close the curtains, turn of ur cellphones and put do not disturb sign on ur door. Best Dark thriller suspense movie you will get to experience.", "Finally, a REAL movieThis movie causes the audience to consider many topics on morality, particularly the poor choices made by the Joker. The Joker is more relatable in this movie than antagonists usually are. I think this gives a more realistic view of \"bad\" people, who are not usually 100% bad in all ways as society often judges. It is important to know when to sympathize with the Joker (towards the beginning of the movie), and when he needs to be identified as a threat (when he begins making certain bad choices). This movie is only suitable for adults who are willing to pick it apart and think critically about it. It isn't for light amusement. That substance is what makes it so good.\n\nIf you aren't able to ponder underlying themes on your own, and you have to be handed all your thoughts to you, then this isn't the best movie for you.", "Good lordThe acting, cinematography, sound design, and the script itself is phenomenal. This movie is a triumph. Joaquin Pheonix deserves an Oscar win for this tbh.", "Joker > EndgameNeed I say more? Everything about this Movie is Masterful in every single way! Joker isn't just an awesome comic book movie, it's an awesome movie, period. It offers no easy answers to the unsettling questions it raises about a cruel society in decline. Joaquin Phoenix's fully committed performance and Todd Phillips' masterful albeit loose reinvention of the DC source material make Joker a film that should leave comic book fans and non-fans alike disturbed and moved in all the right ways.", "Oscar for PhoenixI will stop watching movies if Joaquin Phoenix is not awarded Oscar for his tremendous acting.", "Critics are useless!I quit relying on critic reviews years ago... I noticed for this movie that the critics ratings were low but viewer ratings were high. That being said, what is the point of a critic when for this movie, they are oh so wrong. I went and saw this tonite with my mom. I went in skeptical and w some what low expectations. I knew not to expect your typical super hero movie. What we got was a masterpiece. I went in expecting sheer boredom and I was instead on the edge of my seat the whole time. Not action edge of your seat, it was a fear of what he may do or say next edge of your seat. To see this character evolve into what we all know as the #1 villain of Batman was beyond genius and Joaquin Phoenix is a true master at perfecting the art of consuming himself into this character. I may be all over the place with this but I don't care. This movie, the story, the acting, directing, effects, everyone brought their A game and JP definitely deserves a nod and win for this role. And no, there is no comparison here to Jack Nicholson or Heath Ledger. Each actor took on this character and different levels, different story points and different points in time, so any comparison would just not be feasible or fair to any of the actors as they embraced him and made him come to life in their own genius way!", "Absolute LOVEThis movie was one of the best movies I have ever seen. From the characters personalities, to the wardrobe, to the overall feeling it gives you..an absolute 10/10! The acting was absolutely phenomenal and this movie is one of those I can watch over and over again! Watching this movie gives you a sense of sadness, laughter and at times anger all in one. It shows a different perspective than the overall known villian; that is the Joker. I love that the movie wasn't made so much so an action but more of the backstory of the joker, all being played out in real time. Like I said; this movie for me will be on repeat.", "It's About a ManWhile I've watched many of the superhero movies that have come down the pike, they are often the same. So the compensation for sensational plots involves great special effects and non-stop action. They are fun and I don't mean to dis them. What is missing is a truly psychological drama. We don't get into the heads of the characters. This film is incredible as we watch a man confront his demons. We see him made fun of, attacked, and beaten. When he responds, he is seen as crazy. He also find that he is diminished in the eye of a counselor, and his mother has kept a secret. I thought it gave us a foundation for the Batman mythos without getting to deeply into it. Acting, atmosphere, and a sophisticated plot makes this a really excellent film.", "BELIEVE THE HYPEJoaquin Phoenix gives Heath Ledger a run for his money, true story. This is not a popcorn fluff comic book flick. DO NOT TAKE YOUR KIDS TO SEE THIS MOVIE. Shut down all ballots for the Oscar, Joaquin is taking that one home hands down. One of the best origin stories EVER put out. The only downside to this movie, is that it is a stand alone film that will have no sequels or ties to the DC Universe. Todd Philips take on the Joker is one of pure brilliance and Joaquin Phoenix was the Joker we deserved. He didn't steal from Jack or Heath but yet you got a taste of both.", "Masterpiece.The music. The intense. The realism. The performance. The story. Such a perfect combination of everything. I never felt that a character like joker could be real until I saw this. Phoenix shows us what a joker is in our society and shows us how power can be obtained. Philips on the other hand had the perfect choice of music, camera angles, lighting and every important factor. Overall, I did not expect the story to be this perfect. Too many shocking turns happened and it really does represent today's society. If I was in the first screening, I would have applauded for 80 min not 8.", "Requiem of a broken manThe perfect portrait of a decline to insanity\" & Joaquin Phoenix portrays this flawlessly in a performance of a lifetime. Choreographed impeccably by Todd Phillips & is nothing short of breathtaking. The cinematography & backdrop ideology of such an original film for such a complex character is only complimented by the superb soundtrack & acting. A hauntingly beautiful film & A Definate 10/10. Edit: Bring on part 2 plssssss!. We all want it!.", "Movie of the DecadeThe pool does not need the money. They need the dignity and respect, coz that is what it takes to be a human. If you don't have that, money will only be a reminder of them being a \"good boy\". Like some politicians, they feel so frustrated when people from the lower class does not accept their funding champions. In this movie, through joker's life, I begin to get it.", "Brilliant. And best joker I've ever seenPhoenix convinces me that he has always meant to be the joker. The movie went beyond my expectations, so many emotions went through me these couple hours. I think because its rated R, Phoenix was able to unlock jokers full psychotic potential as the character he is meant to be. This was an AMAZING story, and it calls for more. And I mean a build up, a second movie, maybe one with batman? My hopes are too high at this point, but nevertheless, brilliant goddamn movie and THE BEST joker ever played hands down.", "CLOWN PRINCE OF CRIME has arrived10/10 Amazing story, Brilliant taking, magnificent cinematography. Someone had to step out of the safe game played by Superhero movies and Joker movie does just that (also The Boys). Movie is gritty, real, insanely dark and sometime quite disturbing to people who don't want accept what's shown in the movie is a terrible reality we face everyday if refused a proper care. Normally people start to compare the movie with one of the greatest like The Dark Knight and in acting wise to that of Heath ledger's Potrayal of joker. I wouldn't say this movie is better that that or otherwise , but it will stand tall amongst the greatest like The Godfather, Taxi Driver, Citizen Kane, The Dark Knight. Coming to the inevitable comparison of who's the better Joker? Heath or Joaquin. The answer is Both did a phenomenal job and the Joker character itself is fortunate to have being played by two greatest actors. Definitely a top contender for Oscars. I personally think it would take away 1.Best Actor 2.Cinematography 3.Original score and if Once Upon a time in Hollywood loses in Make-up and hairstyling category it would definitely be to The Joker.", "Loved it!This is just my opinion but I loved the Joker, the performances, cinematography, directing, style, all build a great story. And the acting from Phoenix was incredible, he done a great take for the iconic character, and wow does he commit, with loosing the weight for the role, to developing the laugh.", "Anyone who rates this movie poorly clearly doesn't appreciate cinemaWhile the trailers for this movie have may seemed like there was potential for an action packed movie, this movie, clearly before it came to theaters was intended to be a progressive character study. You shouldn't go into this movie expecting intense action or the joker we know of the past. This is a movie about how Arthur Fleck becomes the Joker.\n\nI have seen so many bad reviews about how boring or slow the movie is, but I believe it was utter perfection. The first part of the movie we begin to understand Arthur as a person. All of his interactions with everyone in his life, be it good or bad. The whole point of a character study is evolution. And this is far and away one of the greatest evolutions of a character I have ever seen in a movie.\n\nJoaquin Phoenix's performance is by far the best acting I have seen in a movie possibly in the last few decades. We see a challenged person be challenged by society and it completely breaks him down over time. And Joaquin isn't acting, he is evolving all throughout the movie. If anyone thinks he doesn't put on an Oscar winning performance, they're out of their effing mind. Yes, the movie is slow to start, but it has to be. We couldn't just jump into the joker and all the chaos. We need to know where it came from to begin with.\n\nThe whole compilation of the movie is amazing. The complete Oscar deserving performance of Joaquin, the choreography, the cinematography, the score. Everything is in perfect harmony. While there may have been a lot of controversy surrounding this movie, the team put together a perfect movie and I pity those who can't appreciate the tears and sweat and emotion that went into making this movie.\n\nI have always been so one sided in my movie preferences between Marvel and DC. I feel like Marvel is sooo much better overall and most movies DC puts out are trash. But Joker is far and away my favorite comic movie. Even though it takes a completely different spin on comic movies. You have to appreciate the evolution to appreciate this movie. It's not an action movie, but it's really rips and tears at all the emotions in one movie while adding a wild suspenseful kick. No other comic book movie has done that before.", "StunningOne of the best movies in these few years and 100% Oscar worthy\n\nJoaquin Phoenix delivers one of the best performances I've ever scene", "Saw it tonight and had to make an account so I can tell everyone how good it isSeriously, unbelievable. Dare I say better than Heath Ledger? If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't win the Oscar for best actor and 'Joker' doesn't win at the VERY least, best screenplay, it will be one of the biggest Oscar snubs of our time", "Astonishing MasterpieceWhat an incredible ride this was. I was almost motionless throughout, watching in awe the performance of a lifetime - the transition from troubled man to monster, the hounding score which directly drove the goosebumps, the cinematography which made you feel like you were flying through Gotham looking for Arthur yourself and the masterful De Niro who gave his nod to Jerry Lewis. Ignore DC. Ignore Batman. This is a work of art in its own right.", "THIS IS HOW A DC MOVIE SHOULD BE!This movie is a masterpiece! It absolutely epitomizes what a DC movie should be. Dark, emotional, thought provoking, not just action action action. One of the best movies I've seen in a long time.\n\nCritics have definitely lost touch with the public and should be ignored on this one. Do yourself a favor and watch it!\n\nAnd remember to be good to one another. You dont know what someone else is going through.", "Stop comparing it with EndgameJoker is literally an achievement in cinematic history there's no doubt in that ! But why people comparing it with Endgame ? Both movies have their own ways and they are completely different. Endgame was the best at its genre. Talking about Joker ... What can I say ... A beautiful presentation of storyline , direction , screenplay was all at its peak of greatness ... Heath ledger smiling down to earth :)", "His best performance to date.Without doubt one of the best movie's that I've ever seen!", "BEST MOVIE OF THE YEARThe movie was excellent and amazing, from the beginning that Joaquin's personality is seen as he evolves in the Joker until the end, Joker is the most difficult character to do and I think Joaquin did it!!", "PerfectCreative actor Joaquin creativity embodied the role of the Joker film deserves more than 10", "MesmerizingThe ending is what matters in a movie.

This is the first time I've ever wrote a review on this app and I've been using it to read reviews for years! That's how good this film is.

Do yourself a favor and go see it!!!", "Took my 65 year old mother to see it.I saw the movie after the opening weekend and loved it. I think it's a masterpiece. Convinced my 65 year old mother too see it, who couldn't even remember whose nemesis the Joker is. She had read about all the negative press about the movie being too violent and taking light of mental health issues.\n\nShe loved the movie. Sympathized for Arthur and was rooting for the Joker (to a certain point) She was surprised about the small amount of violence is depicted after all the press putdown and enjoyed the \"social commentary\" the movie conveys.\n\nHer score: 9 / 10\n\nMom is always right.", "The best thing DC has done since Dark KnightJoker is without a doubt my new favorite DC film. It's dark and gritty but with enough psychological twists that it keeps you guessing from beginning to end. Nothing can be taken at face value and the film forces you to think from beginning to end. Don't listen to the critics, this one is worth watching multiple times in theaters.", "Spectacular, awesome, fantasticThe reality, far from fiction!! That what's made the movie,,, the oscar winner actor made a new joker rivalry with heath ledger joker, better joker in some people opinion.. piece of art", "Best DC movie since The Dark Knight RisesDC can STILL give us a compelling movie. Wasn't quite hyped about it, I mean, an origin story of a villain made by the director of Hangover movies; what could I even expect? Then, the reviews started to drop. Still wasn't sure if I would like it. And after I saw it, it was way better than I thought it would be. I won't call it a masterpiece, but it definitely is on my top 3 DC films of all times!\n\nGood : There's hardly anything bad about Joker. Joaquin Phoenix does a great job of bringing the character into life. Rather than a typical superhero/supervillain origin story, we get to see a psychological drama + horror, and thank God, we got that. I love the genre, I love films like Infinity War, Days of Future Past, Endgame and Raimi's Spider-Man. But occasionally, it's really good to take a break from such films. It's, kind of, in the category of films like Unbreakable. Basically, the movie is (no spoilers ahead) Arthur, being tormented by the society and being a mentally unstable loner, loses his mind after the constant torment and after that, all hell breaks loose. That's all the movie shows. It would be quite difficult to give a really good story for a plot like this, since there are many movies with this kind of plot (awfully crappy ones included). I completely liked this movie, means the screenplay and direction worked for me. You can feel for Arthur, whenever the movie asks you to. You want to root for Arthur, but you know that it will mean some incredibly terrible things will happen. We see him slowly transition into Joker, and when he completely turns into the Joker it is worth a round of applause. We feel good as well as terrified with the actions of the Joker whenever he snaps and crazy stuff happens. Without getting into spoilers, I would say - in short - that it has many quotable lines and each of them make sense. Whatever Joker (a psychopath) says is more realistic than what a sane person says. And obviously has some sick, terrifying and gruesome Joker moments that a proper Joker movie should have. If it's not clear by the trailers, there's no Batman here. But (again, no spoilers) it does have some Batman references to support the movie. It could've created a mess and might have felt like a shoehorned plotline, but it plays out as a proper support for the main story and the transition of Arthur into Joker.\n\nMixed : It is a good thing that the movie has a 70s psycho horror vibe to it. But, it could've been more original. Like many others have pointed out, it's similar to Taxi Driver by Scorsese. While it wasn't a copy and paste of Taxi Driver, but some parts make it obvious that the movie was inspired by Taxi Driver. Not necessarily a bad thing, the movie has the elements as a homage-ish way, but looking at how well made it was, it could've been slightly more original. And, it may feel a bit slow for some people, though it's worth your time.\n\nMy take on the controversy : It can happen that some morons might watch this film and cause violence. It can happen with any violent movie. But, even though it justified the Joker's actions, it doesn't show them to be right. Speaking of violence, it's just psychologically compelling horror. It's less violent than Deadpool, but feels more violent as it's a serious movie. So, glorification and siding with a psychopath is a complete and total nonsense.\n\nConclusion : It's a must watch. You don't need to follow any of the DC movies to understand it. But do not expect it to be a typical superhero action film with CGI battles and a spectacle. Wrong expectations might ruin the experience. Else, I found it to be better than The Dark Knight Rises. And TDKR is one of my favorites in the genre. If a Nolan movie is replaced by another movie in my list, you may consider it to be great. One last thing, people causing violence because of Joker would be equivalent to The Good, The Bad and The Ugly inspiring three people to have a gun duel for some gold.\n\nRating:\n\nScore : 10/10\n\nGrade : A+", "Amazing movieBest acting and story.

It's realistic, not over the top, and it's something that we should all reflect on. On how we treat our peers. I've always been a fan of superhero/villain movies, but this will remain to be one of the best I've ever seen.", "A MASTERPIECE\"Joker\" (2019) - A Masterpiece of Cinema\n\nRating: 10/10\n\n\"Joker,\" directed by Todd Phillips, is nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece. It's a bold, gritty reimagining of one of the most iconic villains in popular culture, but it transcends the superhero genre to become a profound character study, driven by Joaquin Phoenix's electrifying performance.\n\nPhoenix's portrayal of Arthur Fleck, a deeply troubled man who descends into madness, is one of the finest acting performances in modern cinema. His ability to capture the nuances of a broken soul, teetering on the edge of chaos, is both haunting and mesmerizing. Every scene he's in is magnetic, pulling viewers into his unraveling psyche. Phoenix's physical transformation, from his skeletal appearance to his erratic laughter, solidifies him as a force of nature, delivering a performance that is both unsettling and deeply tragic.\n\nThe film's cinematography is equally stunning. Lawrence Sher, the director of photography, crafts each frame with meticulous care, using color, shadow, and composition to reflect Arthur's journey from isolation to infamy. The use of muted tones in the beginning to emphasize Arthur's bleak existence, followed by more vibrant hues as he embraces his Joker persona, enhances the film's psychological depth. The iconic stairs scene, shot with a mix of exhilaration and menace, will remain etched in cinematic history for its symbolic power.\n\n\"Joker\" also benefits from a gripping score by Hildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir, whose eerie and melancholic music perfectly complements the film's dark, oppressive atmosphere.\n\nOverall, \"Joker\" stands as a remarkable achievement in storytelling, acting, and visual artistry. It is a thought-provoking and disturbing exploration of mental illness, societal neglect, and the human condition, making it one of the most impactful films of the decade. A true masterpiece.", "I hope my death makes more sense than my lifeI will not change the grades that I set after 1 viewing!\n\nI vote for emotions during the introduction. Now, of course, the film does not produce the same impressions, but it was good.\n\nSo, a comparison with a Taxi Driver. Both there and there is a hero with mental breakdowns, and there and there is a woman with whom the main character is in love, and there and there there are murders due to the fact that bad people get the good ones, and there and there the so-called garbage accumulates on the streets.\n\nWell, there is a reference, there is surveillance of a woman. Well, society takes the side of murderers when it comes to killing bad guys. In a taxi driver, it looked like an idea to think about, but in the gloomy fictional city of Gotham... well, what's normal) Of course, you can get to the bottom of it and compare all the common elements to say that one copies the other, but why? The emotional coloring of the films is different, as well as the depth of disclosure of the characters, as well as the plot as a whole.\n\nThe film is a little bit about something else. A person with mental disorders wants to be like Murray, but he makes fun of him. And there will be no peaceful solution after that...\n\nI don't want to delve into the plot, because retelling is bad. I'll highlight the elements that also look cool, like the first time.\n\nHow it was shot, what angles, colors were selected. Music also helps the gloomy atmosphere. The process of development, although it would be more appropriate to call it character degradation. Some scenes of climbing and descending the stairs are worth a lot.", "Now THIS is a Movie!!Where to begin?? The cinematography is stunning, the soundtrack is phenomenal, the story is brilliant, and the costume design is show-stopping! This film always leaves me in awe. Joaquin Phoenix's performance in the movie was absolutely incredible and honestly his best work yet in my opinion! I love that this film incorporated delusion vs. Reality; makes you wonder what all was actually real.\n\nSome people might consider this film to be too boring and all I have to say to that is, sorry you clearly don't understand quality cinema!\n\nThis is truly one of my favorite films and I'm so excited for the next one! I fear it might be just as, if not more so, amazing as this one :)", "By far the best DC movie to date, Joaquin Phoenix was perfect.Wow, what a movie! I have to admit, When I first heard Joaquin Phoenix was going to be the joker, I was surprised. I wasn't sure how he was going to pull it off. I was hoping it wasn't going to be another cheesy rendition full of fluff and unrealistic explanations of how the Joker came to be. One where my (adult) son wouldn't have to keep nudging me to wake me up. I was pleasantly surprised on well Todd Phillips' version played and Joaquin's acting was superb. You could feel the anguish his character was going through right up to the point he lost his mind. Just an excellent, well acted movie that you almost forget is derived from a DC comic.", "Cinematic MasterpieceActing, Cinematography, Music, Screenplay, Costumes, Gotham etc everything is 10/10.Oscar worthy performanceby by Joaquin Phoenix.Amazing directing by Todd Phillips & amazing cinematography by Lawrence Sher.", "10/10 no questionDriving to watch it I was excited while expecting less.

Please consider that Phoenix's Joker is a journey to becoming the Heath's Joker and in my opinions it was perfect. Close to the end of the movie you can see a glimpse of Heat's Joker, the one that embraces his madness and starts enjoying being the villain.", "The Rise of the Joker!Joaquin' portrayal of a sociopathic, mentally unstable man's transformation to the iconic Joker was non other than a grippingly accurate, realistic and touching rendition. A dark and disturbing character piece led by an Oscar worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix. You really do feel bad for this guy, which makes it all the more heartbreaking when he inevitably becomes the clown prince of crime we all know and love, although we've never seen him like this. We see him suffer throughout the movie to the point we're almost rooting for himk to become a mass murdering psyco clown, because that at least will make feel better; then it happens and we just wish this could have all just been avoided, because es so messed up. We feel for him and care about him. By the time he's the joker, we wish we could've helped him. There's a lot of great nods to the greater Batman universe, yet the movie is a self contained character piece. That can only be the mark of a great movie. All the acting is great, the plot (while similar to Taxi Driver) is brilliant and the quality of the movie shows you don't need CGI super powers to be a great villain in a Superhero movie. Is a joke not everyone gets. This movie is \"the rise of the Joker!\" 10/10", "Film of the year (if not of the decade)I heard all the hype about this film and as a skeptic at heart I came into this film with the most critical mindset possible.\n\nI just finished watching it and I am absolutely speechless. I don't think a film such as this has ever been made in Hollywood before. The slow and steady fall of the Joker into complete insanity is just so realistic that you feel a strange empathy towards him and almost come to justify his actions even when he commits the most heinous crimes. This is what makes this film so incredible, it takes the \"villain/good guy\" type of film making and just flips it right on its head.\n\nThe cinematography captures this perfectly, you never feel rushed into a scene and yet it keeps you glued to your seat (thanks also to the music and score which contour this film perfectly).\n\nJoaquin Phoenix gives the performance of the century and only thanks to his brilliance is this film even possible. I feel sorry for the actors who gave Oscar-worthy performances this year, as Mr. Phoenix's acting in this film is just from another planet and deserves all the accolades it can get.", "There are movies.. And there are masterpieces. This is one of them!I really liked the way heath ledger portrayed joker in dark knight. Funny, cunning, evil. If he was living today, he would have aced this movie. But surprisingly, Joaquin does it even better. He is rarely funny but very alone and pathetic. His condition becomes worse and worse until he breaks out, wreaking havoc to Gotham. The story flows smoothly through Arthur's life, how the situation around influences him to become the joker. The supporting characters including Robert de Niro have done an excellent job but nobody can beat Joaquin. He was at a completely different level!! A pure masterclass of cinema. If you are a fan of joker, don't miss this one! Another Oscar worthy performance from Joaquin. If he gets it, it ll be second time for the same role.", "TRAGEDY=COMEDYMy one of the favourite lines from the movie was...joker saying to himself,,,\"I used to think that my life is a TRAGEDY but now i realise that it is nothing but COMEDY\"....so, u can imagine how disturbing a movie could be with it's theme being 'TRAGEDY=COMEDY'...but it was not that disturbing for me as i am used to of or aware of the ongoing social-political structure of our country !!!\n\nIt has got those 'Dark Knight' (arguably one of the finest superhero movie ever made) vibes...i had an emotional ride, watching small Bruce Wane (Nolan's batman) meeting Joker, getting to know the pre batman story of the Gotham city and the back story or the building-up of the 'Joker the villain' of dark night.....IT WAS QUITE NOSTALGIC FOR ME IN THAT WAY !!!", "Good showcase of societyAs someone that suffers from multiple mental Illnesses portrayed in this film by Joaquin Phoenix, I can testify how good this movie really is. In a time when it is becoming more commonplqce to discuss this kind of thing, we needed this movie. This is the greatest showcase of mental illness and of how society has treated those of us with it. Great film that everybody needs to see even though it makes you extremely uncomfortable. That's the point.", "If you're an outcast, you'll understand this movieAnd I'm not saying you need to be a freak. Many of us play the role, put on the mask, pretend like it's all good and normal. But deep inside, we're all Joker.\n\nThis movie is a masterpiece and Joaqin is incredible. I don't think anyone could've done this movie as well as he did. Why? Because he's playing a role in real life. This was him just being him, the outcast.", "Absolutely brilliantThe acting, the story, the dialogue, the cinematography, the soundtrack, everything was true art.

What a brilliant performance by Phoenix.", "Best Joker Movie to dateThis movie.... this movie is beyond amazing! Finally seeing the origin story for the Joker makes it so much easier to understand him and why he does what he does. The emotion in the acting, the dancing, the story with his mother. It's a movie I could watch over and over again. I felt bad for the Joker, scared of the Joker, and proud of him all at once. This was definitely one of the best movies I've seen in a while. I might even watch it again this morning.", "DifferentIn this movie you get to see a side I've never seen of the joker. It builds sympathy for a character I would of never had. I feel sorry for him and what he goes through.", "Is there a need for a box-office uprising?You have to see this film to believe it. It's a masterpiece. More so in a world where comicbook-blockbusters and cash crabs rule Hollywood. Todd Philipps and Joaquin Phoenix did what nobody in their wildest dream could imagine: to make one of the most profitable movies with a small kind of art-house film in the DC-Batman-universe. Thanks to Philipps and Phoenix, a great many young people watched for the first time an honest movie which was made with a very special vision and told almost perfectly the story about a man struggling with life and how society interacts with him. The soundtrack alone is worth the admission. But the performance of Phoenix is out of this world. After I saw the soulless, brainless Star Wars 9 episode, I wonder when will the audience break away from movies which scripts are written from marketing and merchandising hacks. It seems there is a strong need for a box-office uprising.", "Best Movie of 2019Everything about Joker is Masterpiece especially Joaquin Phoenix legendary performance.", "Just brilliantJoaquin was amazing.

Not only does it continue a new movie, it also gives a new perspective to a new, crazier, more psychopath batman movie, without those cgi things. And another thing, Joaquin Phoenix didn't look at first look like a possible Joker, but i was totally wrong, he was the best and Heathen Ledger would be proud.

The plot and music where both incredible as well. I was entertained the entire time!", "Realistic Origin & Amazing, Gritty PerformanceThe film starts off slow but straight off the bat, compelling, interesting look into the life of Arthur Fleck, Joker. It is unclear whether or not this is the Infamous Joker aka Batman's nemesis. Without trying to spoil anything, it is unclear whether or not some parts of this origin are true or not, and this is because of an unreliable narrator/main character. This is what makes this movie stand out just as plenty of other stories do as well. The ability to give the audience/reader a chance to analyze the material and theorize themselves what it is that is being discussed or viewed. It was honestly an amazing performance by Joaquin Phoenix. It was reminiscent of Ledger's haunting performance that was truly one of a kind. And so is Joaquin's. It was a psychological masterpiece of not only the development of a character (one of the best like walter white level, and Joker is just a 2 hr movie) but the cinematography that made this mental breakdown come to life. I don't know whats up with the critics, but they definitely got this one wrong.\n\nI don't believe this needs a sequel... this is by far the greatest origin story for a mysterious villain arch storyline. And this coming from a Wolverine fan, Logan was great, this was superior... all we need is a Punisher Origin story, in the idea of Platoon. Joker deserves a 9.7.", "You don't take risk making a movies, you just make a good movieBelieve the hype, instant classic! this movie is one of the best movies you'll see in a long time.. The acting was from another planet. Joaquin deserves a statue! and director Todd shows how to make movies again. Quality cinema! for the Batman fans there is also a lot to find...if you want to know why Gotham sucks and why Batman was needed (Dark Night Batman) go and see this movie.

The movie is flawless but because of its approach on mental illness and the execution of Joaquin Phoenix. The 80's settings brings a darker filter to it, creating a scenario where you see no hope for a person as the main character to survive. The movie does not praise violence and it's far from being about making the Joker a \"hero\" or him starting a movement, it's all about a man trying to find himself. Violence is what happens in between and labelling the movie as such is a misinterpretation of the picture. Also, if the movie had no reference whatsoever of the Batman universe it would work the same, it is a movie that sustains itself from beginning to end delivering frame by frame what it was meant to.", "ReviewI saw this movie 2 times. It's a masterpiece. Every time I saw this this movie it made me cry and I can feel the pain of the character. joaquin performance is marvelous. In the conclusion I can say it is best movie of the dc.", "An original dark comedy about class strugglesThis is a well written and well perfomed original film. With a lot of repetitive cinema these day i felt this was something new. I felt connected and engaged with the character throughout the film. There are several well directed tense moments throughout the film. A popular topic of class struggled well portrayed. Its always nice to see foreign language films having worldwide success.", "Achieves what Jordan Peele set out to do with UsAs a film about a family imposing on another, and keeping dark secrets hidden beneath the surface, Parasite achieves what Jordan Peele set out to do with Us: tell a multi-layered story in a widely entertaining manner, but without sacrificing the believability of its central narrative.\n\nThat's not to say that Us is an ineffective film by any means, but when it comes to crafting weighty social commentaries under the guise of lighter fare, writer-director Bong Joon-ho is in a class of his own.\n\nThe film follows a lower-class South Korean family as they slowly integrate themselves in the lives of an upper-class family and their lavish household. As their entanglement is spun out of a web of deceit, the lowly family find themselves skating on thin ice when it comes to keeping up appearances.\n\nIt's a twisty satire on social-economic disparities in South Korean society that swings broadly in tone, and sometimes threatens to tip over the edge, but never feels less than meticulously calculated in its tonal shifts.\n\nHowever, to reveal anything more about the story would be to take away from the overall experience, as each act is marked by a major plot twist or revelation that keeps the film one step ahead of the viewer at all times. Go in blind if you can and expect an unforgettable ride.", "Multilayered portrayal of the real KoreaThis is a movie about a class struggle in South Korea, like what movie \"Us\" attempts to do but done properly. It is a stark reminder of what true living standards for most South Koreans look like, and its realism is very painful. Few are aware of the fact that up to the 1980s, South Korea was in fact more impoverished than North Korea, and it was only late that the situation reversed with famines of the 90s etc, but many people still live miserable lives, and situation is very similar to that in China, where a few got gloriously rich but the urban masses still live in bug infested cheap dwellings.\n\nSome crafty members of this underclass manage to con contemptuous rich man into employing them as his servants. For many Asians smell is a way to express utter contempt, and this is often directed against the white people, who, being able to process milk, smell \"like butter\" and are seen in rac ist light as unclean, but the same rac ist contempt is directed towards the poor. The poor accept these valuations and fight for the crumbles, like roaches in the dark, but in life and death situations, resentment might boil up and the contempt might cost the rich their empty heads.\n\nThe movie paints a sad picture of modern East Asian societies, with many subtle points, criticizes their culture and emulation of the America, with a few cruel but precise strokes. The sheer talent of the Korean filmmaker, but also the fact that West likes movies from foreign countries that are self bashing, allowing the worst condescension rooted in colonialism that failed miserably in East Asia to thrive, one more reason to cheer this slightly overrated movie.", "Whose the parasite and whose the cow?!What an amazing film! Clearly an essay on the class divide. Writing lovable but nasty people is tough, but perfectly executed here.\n\nThey quite clearly cross the line, and when I mean \"they\" I mean bother the working class and the upper class. You could easily argue that \"parasite\" refers to one family trying to suck another family dry. Or that the upper class is draining the labour of the lower class, and expecting them to be grateful about it too! There is also something about the American Indian theme, a metaphor for dying cultural traditions which are being replaced by modernity? Nature is dog eat dog? Or is it a homage to an \"idyllic\" past where Native American culture was relatively classless?\n\nEither way a must watch if you can handle subtitles!", "Totally UniqueUsually I don't read reviews before seeing a film. This one, however, I did, and happily so. First of all, it was good to know what cinema in Korea is all about. We need to shed our cultural biases, including \"how\" to make films. This had a very clever plot and an engaging group of characters. The title, I assume, means the principle figures have managed to infest a body and then use it to sustain themselves. I hope to see more from this director in the future.", "Parasite (2019)Director Bong Joon-ho's global sensation, Parasite, is an allegorical tale of class warfare. Before watching the film, I was familiar with its high praise but knew little of its actual plot. If possible, I'd recommend other viewers similarly go into this one as cold as they can. While Parasite deals with heavy themes (economic mobility, climate change), it does so in ways that are constantly entertaining and surprising. A unique blend of drama, suspense, comedy, and horror, Parasite provides further proof that cinema is a truly universal language.", "Another great Korean film.This was one of my favourite films, great acting, I liked the characters and there was lots of suspense.", "how sick/weird is this movie and still catch you inThe only thing i would change on it ,is the end... , why the hell all that had to happen, the movie would be great with a different end.\n\nOverall this is quit intresting to watch... , to understand the culture , the limits between poverty and rich people , there is more but i don't want to spoiler it , so it worth to watch.\n\nThe movie ended in hurry somehow ,not showing the life of Kim Ki-woo , i like that for the first time i see quality into this korean/chinese/japanese culture movies recorded .\n\nThis movie is pure fiction , but is not feeling like it couldn't become a real thingh , because doesn't look that unrealistic to happen .\n\nI note it for 9 , because i would give it a different ending and a part 2 ! ,but maybe the director of the movie didn't had same vision as us tend to have .. , he wanted something sad to happen and the movie to don't end in just a happy end.", "Make any plan is an all-time joke.The film is a contemporary cinamatic adaptation of the Sisyphus myth.

I thought that the most simple comparison to make is between this and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.

I never felt out of touch with what was going on because I didn't understand that culture or anything along those lines, and that's why I highly recommend this movie to anyone. Parasite also has many outstanding shots and high level filmmaking in general. Visuals never dissapoint. The movie is so well paced and gets pretty wild toward the end without being ridiculous. The twists and turns it made were one of the most entertaining Ive seen in a while. There isn't much else to disect.

It was mixed of comedy, suspense and even horror, go see it you'll be suprised!", "Sadistic comedy and brilliant tragedy all bundled up into the best film of 2019.There I said it---It's the best film of the year for this reviewer, and it's the best film Bong Jong-ho has made to date.\n\nBut to be fair, I've yet to see \"The Irishman,\" \"1917,\" and \"A Hidden Life,\" so my opinion could change. Though, I can't see that being likely.\n\nThe originalness of \"Parasite\" is what sets it apart. \"Parasite,\" twists and turns to darker and darker places while still maintaining a comedic tone. There's ingenious visual cinematography and storytelling when it portrays the division of class between the wealthy and poor.\n\nClass inequality is a theme director Bong Joon-ho frequently uses. You observe it in his other films, \"Snowpiercer,\" \"Okja,\" and even in the first film I ever saw of his back in 2006 with Joon-ho's horror film, \"The Host.\" Which also starred Kang-ho Song who plays, Kevin's father in \"Parasite.\" He's hilariously witty in both films.\n\n\"Parasite\" set in South Korea, is about a young man from an impoverished family, the Kims, who winds up with a job to tutor a high school girl from an extremely affluent family, the Parks. He changes his name from Kim Ki-woo to Kevin to impersonate an English tutor. He soon realizes this could be a way to get his whole family employment under the Parks, and the family makes it their plan to do-so.\n\nThe film shined when it cinematically showed the differences between class equality among these two very different families. When we see the wealthy Park family, the house is pristinely clean. A complete contrast to the Kim family apartment, which is a basement apartment littered with trash and infested by stink bugs, in what looks to be one of the poorest sections of the city.\n\nIf you like dark comedies, then you're sure to enjoy \"Parasite.\" I've witnessed people who don't like foreign films because of subtitle-hatred still relish this film.\n\nYou won't see another movie like \"Parasite,\" perhaps ever. Well done, Bong Joon-ho.", "Simple yet realisticThis is undoubtedly one of the best movies of the year and I think the best work of Bong Joon Ho yet. It's a very funny and playful movie. You can't pin it down into one specific genre, much like Bong Joon Ho's other work. Some moments are absurdly funny while others are intense. The premise is about a poor family who lives in a small basement apartment and struggling in their everyday life. One day one of their family members gets a chance to work as an English tutor for the daughter of a wealthy family. The poor family sees this as an opportunity to scam this wealthy family and they find a way to all work for them. Things get more serious after the first half because some stuff happens and the poor family has to deal with it cautiously. What is amazing about this movie is the story is simple and realistic, but told in such a fresh and unique way that it feels relatable and larger than life. The director shows the irony of life. How two separate classes of people in a society perceive things differently. While watching the movie, it was so engaging that I felt like it was controlling me with its beautiful cinematography and well structured plot.", "Social satire on steroidsBong Joon-ho's Parasite is perfectly written, filmed, and played - a bit too much at times (did we need this Ri Chun-hee's impersonation, or was that a bonus for Western audiences?).\n\nNo spoilers, but you're forced to understand the gimchi will somehow hit the fan, to want to know, among all possible worst case scenarios, which one will prevail, and to enjoy the ever darker humor first permeating, then overflowing this over the top gem.\n\nIf this brilliant epic echoes Im Sang-soo's 'The Housemaid' & Kim Ki-duk's '3 iron', Bong remains a league of his own.", "What a good movie looks likeThis movie is clever on so many levels, the acting is impeccable, the story-line unexpected and the directing flawless but I don't want to give too much away, just watch it. In this era of super heroes and sequels, this is a breath of fresh air and a sign that there's still hope for the craft.", "So many twists and turns I got whiplashI thought I knew what was happening but it turns out I didnt even know what I didnt know. Cinematography was so well done. Comedy relief at the exact moments it needed it.

By chance, the son in the family starts working for the wealthy Park family. He teaches their daughter English. Now the rest of the family sees opportunities to make money, and they have a plan to remove the rest of the staff who work for the wealthy Park family and then take the jobs themselves.\n\nBong Joon Ho addresses deeper themes, but he always manages to create entertainment and some surprising scenes that bring out the smile. The movie is mostly charming until the Kim family discovers the big secret of the house.\n\nThen the movie starts to get darker, and it explodes into a wonderful finale where we see and understand the message of the movie. The title of the movie turns things on its head. Because what I thought to be quite obvious at the beginning of the movie is turned upside down and I got an aha experience. Parasites are found in all classes of society.\n\nFrom a technical aspect I think this was a beautifully crafted film from the direction to the cinematography. There are so many beautiful scenes in the movie, and it's pretty well done considering that most of the action takes place inside the big house and the not so big garden.My favorite sequence is when the Kim family has to run home when the rain is pouring down, and you feel like they're on board the Titanic. They must run from the top and down to the engine room. What a wonderful sequence, and it's so beautiful to watch!\n\nThe cast was fantastic, and everyone fit the needs of their roles. The characters were well-written with the performances complementing that perfectly. It does a great job of creating a collection of characters that feel like real people, whom despite their eccentricities, maintained a grounded, realistic feel.The musical score complements the scenes nicely and elevates the emotional responses without feeling overbearing.\n\nSo, if you like foreign films, thrillers, or movies that can make you think a little check this one out. It's a crisp film from a technical aspect, and with a blend of great writing and acting you can't go wrong. It was a solid film that treats the audience with intelligence. 9/10", "The hype is warranted.I've wanted to see this awhile, but the consistent rave reviews actually made me hesitate and put it off, for fear of disappointment...nothing is ever that good... but I genuinely and thoroughly loved this!\n\nThe themes are common enough, but told in such a way, and with such a unique story, to be legitimately fresh. The subtle nuances of performance can sometimes get lost in subtitles, but not in this case - each actor transcends language in conveying their character. The plot twists and turns between random chuckles and stark darkness from the start to the shocking, sad and satisfying finish.\n\nThe hype is real - definitely one of the best movies of the year, and of recent years. Don't miss it.", "too much greatThis movie has 2 parts, the first one a kind of comedy, but too much smart, and the second is a complete tragedy, This year the Oscar Awrd is very interesting, there are wonderful movies and Parasite is one of them", "The best film in 2019I doubt that there's a better film out there than this masterpiece in 2019!\n\nAlmost everything about this film was perfect with numerous messages, elements and layers.\n\nThe production and performance were magnificent.

Hi I'm Steffany. World Cinema has got to be apprecited. Enough of Titanics, and Avengers already!!", "'Parasite' is generous in giving you the cerebral foodParasite is a deep, complex, layered, multidimensional and heartfelt portrayal of the class struggle and its gruesome ramifications existing in the present day South Korea. It is seen through a social prism where the haves are pitted against the haven'ts, the haven'ts are pitted against each other . It is also a subtle tale of the dangerous magnitude of the impacts of human greed and how nature backfires against a consumer culture. From the gift rock to the deluge towards the climax, Director Bong Joon Ho of 'Memories of Murder' and 'The Host' fame uses several metaphors to depict how nature backlashes against human's imperialistic pleasures . As a result, what starts in a mild satirical tone, climaxes in a disturbing manner, so much to the extent that even hours after finishing the movie, you can not actually get out of the eerie milieu of South Korean urban class struggle. This is no easy movie, let me remind you. But if you can finish the journey, it can stay with you forever, for the ample food for thought it offers. Truly a cinematic masterpiece from the ace Korean director. Predicting huge applause at the Academy Awards this year, may be the Holy Grail of movie making as well. A must watch for those who are cerebrally way ahead of the cheap DC Comics genre.", "Best film of 2019A great movie. Not a dull moment. What a great script , acting and directing. Probably one of the most original and entertaining film I've seen in many years. A tragedy wrapt up in a comedy genre.", "A Thrilling ExperienceInspite of movie it was more of a experience and a great one.. So much genres in a single movie and all of them are completely justified with the characters and dialogues...", "Great film, great filmmaker.I've loved every film of Bong Joon Ho's that I've scene dating back to the Host. One of the premier auteurs of our generation. This film did what so few films do in our current era, it genuinely surprised. The film is as authentically original and inspired as people are saying it is.\n\nLoved it.", "interesting concept, excellent performanceIt's not a horror nor alien movie despite the title and cover. Nevertheless, the storyline kept me on edge the entire time. The concept is so interesting, even though it's common one. The development is very unique, and I was pleasantly surprised. There was never a dull moment!\n\nGiven the premise of the story, it was interesting to see the prevalence of the family bond in the movie. That aspect of it was very touching.\n\nI found the ending good, but a little bland given everything the story went through.\n\nGreat movie, very psycho!", "Movie of the yearThis film is completely out of the box, a social critic that doesn't choose sides. An absolutely brilliant masterpiece that takes us to a roller coaster of emotions with some kind of new cinematographic genre, that shudder and leave us groundless in a state of deep reflection about the model of society in which we live in. For those looking for an innovative film, with an unusual style, and with a necessary and relevant reflexion, Parasite is the right and the better choice. Impressive work by the director.", "CuriosityI watched this movie three times. it was fantastic and masterpiece like everyone said. there are tons of videos about this movie/subtext on youtube. I was wondering, while the director was reviewing the comments, was it something similar he thought during the filmmaking process or are people going too deep. light/dark, high/low, smell, rich/poor all these contrast are just beautiful.", "Don't Miss ItThis is my second viewing of Parasite and it's just as good as the first time I saw it a few months ago. It's been winning lots of awards and deservedly so. Ki-taek and his family live in a dingy basement and struggle to make ends meet, but when they see an opportunity to insinuate themselves into the wealthy Park family they devise a plan that, at first, is working like a charm. It's very amusing and with great performances, and you'll be surprised by the conclusion. This Korean film is about family and class division, and no matter how good a plan you have you can't plan for the unexpected. Parasite is the well deserved winner of the Palme d'or at last year's Cannes Film Festival.", "Great ThrillerThis film is amazing. Mixes elements of comedy, suspense, and drama in a beautiful manner. I forgot I was reading subtitles after the film, as I was so engaged during the screening. Fantastic plot twists and very interesting and unique character developments. Would give 10th star if it weren't for a couple plot holes.", "Class Division and Lack of Empathy - Is It Innate?Bong Joon Ho's tragicomedy that is a \"comedy without clowns, and tragedy without villains\" (Ho, 2019) is a masterful painting of the division between classes and all the implications and ramifications that come with it. Parasite puts us in the shoes of a low class family and walks us into the life of the elite, making sure to land both class' realities and idiosyncrasies precisely and delicately through the superb acting, meticulous production design and breath-takingly purposeful cinematography. Although the bold and blunt screenplay narrates and exposes our lack of empathy in dealing with people of different classes, refreshingly, the shot selection during a small scene in the second act shows the interaction of a house maid and her boss through the differing perspectives of an adult and a child. In this sequence the directory of photography first shows us the perspective of the adult wherein she is looking over at the boss and her maid and sees a clear visual divide between the two. When the camera shows us the same scene from the perspective of the child, no such barrier is present, and they are on the same side. Bong Joon Ho has exquisitely created a universe that mirrors the realities of his home country today without knowing that the same story resonates through out the globe. Through the chaos that pursues because of the interlacing of these two contrasting families both in the film and in our everyday lives, I believe we need to go back to the mindset of a child wherein we stop seeing people as defined by their social economic status and strive to see each other simply as humans.", "amazing movie.This movie shows desires of poor which is all same in any country of world. well acted and well made film.", "It's hypnoticYou have to watch it for yourself to appreciate the story telling and cinematography. I'm a superhero, dumb action flicks type of person but once in a while I can appreciate a good film and this is it.", "Class Struggle and Deception The Visual Representation.Directed by Bong Joon-ho. \"Parasite\" follows the members of a poor household (Kim) scheming to become employees of a much wealthier family (Park) by posing as unrelated, highly qualified individuals.\n\nThis movie exceeded my expectations. What a way to showcase class struggles and differences between the wealthy and financially lacking in brilliantly done social commentary! This movie feels like it's moving at lightning pace because of how effortlessly it flows. There isn't a dull moment to it, you're either on edge or learning more about it's well-defined characters. Each is distinct and so well performed. I recognized Korean-Canadian actor Woo-sik Choi from \"Train to Busan\" (he's looking fine in this too btw XD) as the brother Ki-Woo. I may be biased because I've grown to really like seeing him, but he was my favorite character in this film. I see him as the main character since he really starts the film with a conversation and ends it with a monologue to his father. Really well done, applause to you sir!\n\nI loved seeing the scheming involved in this, with a name like \"Parasite\" I thought this was going to be sci-fi in nature. But it's not at all! It's more of a home invasion film where the rich owners willingly allow these people to come into their lives. The Kim family were some sneaky ba****** let me tell you and I loved it! It's like a better version of Ocean's films (sorry fans of that series), but with less heisting and more actual manual labour. But still a lot of deception, showing class division without making the rich too \"villain-like\". So seeing as the story/screenplay was superb, it's of course coupled with great camerawork/visual representations and an on-point soundtrack to back it up. There's some amazing parallel driven scenes that involve flooding that show that you don't have to treat an audience like they need to be spoon-fed information. Which I appreciate a lot! I'm so glad this film had a U.S. release because not having people over here see it because of subtitles...that would be tragic! I want more foreign films released in theatres over here to be honest!\n\nThis by far is one of the best films of 2019. It's thrilling, funny, tragic and very very intelligent. Please watch it if you haven't! I'm definitely going to have to check out more from the director/co-writer because he's impressed me highly and clearly is a master at his own craft. I love Asian cinema and foreign films in general, this is exactly why. You miss out on so much greatness if you stick to only \"your language\" while watching films. Don't be one of those people! I'm going to have to watch the movie a few more times to really pick up on everything. Also final side-note, the poster for this film is genius. You'll know what I mean once you've watched it.", "Great allegoryI predict a strong hard campaign to make this South Korean movie become a hype until to get its deserved Oscar. The allegory is pretty awesome. I recommend to get a blindly watch, because this could be very useful. I'm gonna pay attention more on next Joon-ho Bong's projects.", "Make a plan, life will change it...I didn't know what to expect from Parasite. After a few minutes, I found myself with the same feeling in my gut as the first time I saw Rocky. I was really rooting for this impoverished but street smart, underdog of a family. The story moved forward and I found myself not sure of how I felt about them and their charade. The acting and directing are tremendous! The pace of the film leaves you suspended in anxiety. But what an incredible film it is. Without question one of the best films I've seen in the last five years. Certainly the sleeper film for the Academy Award. Excellent, 9/10.", "Great movie!Great movie! I didn't expect that. I actually just watch it because it was nominated to the oscars but ended really enjoying it. It's definitely going to win best foreign movie", "Fantastic !This film is really good and makes you think deeply about the situations it shows. The duality between the protagonist family and the rich Park's is shown in such a wonderful, realistic manner. This type of storytelling has been long missing and I hope more movie makers follow in this trend - in their own original way of course.\n\nMy one complaint was that the film is slow in some middle parts; some scenes last longer than they should. This could be a cultural difference in film-making, as another South Korean film I watched had these instances as well. Still, it's not enough for me to completely give up on it. It's a proper thriller, American films have tried to pull this off throughout the whole of last decade, but failed (with the exception of \"Get Out.\") You laugh, you're sent to the edge of your seat, you get angry, and finally you feel sad. You know a movie is great when it's able to awaken so many emotions and leave you talking about different interpretations of the film long after you've watched it.\n\nI'm glad South Korean films are getting the attention they deserve. I've watched other South Korean films in the past and they are excellent storytellers. Congratulations to everyone involved with this film, you all did an amazing job and I'm happy your hard work has been recognized on an international level.\n\nHighly recommend this film and if you're avoiding it due to subtitles or the non-sensible bad reviews, you're sorely missing out.", "A Riveting and Genre-Defying MasterpieceThe film centers around the Kim family, who live in poverty and struggle to make ends meet in a cramped basement apartment. Through a stroke of luck, the son, Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik), secures a tutoring job for the wealthy Park family. As the Kims infiltrate the lives of the Parks, their symbiotic relationship takes unexpected turns, leading to a series of gripping and suspenseful events.\n\nBong Joon-ho's direction in \"Parasite\" is masterful, seamlessly blending elements of dark comedy, drama, and thriller to create a unique and immersive cinematic experience. The film's pacing is impeccable, with each scene meticulously crafted to build tension and keep the audience on the edge of their seats. Bong's ability to balance humor and suspense while delving into profound social themes is a testament to his storytelling prowess.\n\nThe performances in \"Parasite\" are exceptional across the board. The ensemble cast, including Song Kang-ho as the patriarch of the Kim family and Lee Sun-kyun as the affluent Mr. Park, deliver nuanced and captivating portrayals of their characters. Their chemistry and the dynamic interactions between the Kim and Park families add layers of complexity and depth to the narrative.\n\n\"Parasite\" is a film that defies easy categorization. It seamlessly transitions between genres, blending elements of satire, suspense, and social realism. Bong Joon-ho's screenplay is a meticulously crafted exploration of class dynamics, inequality, and the human desire for upward mobility. The film offers sharp social commentary, challenging the audience to examine the systems that perpetuate inequality and the lengths individuals will go to improve their circumstances.\n\nVisually, \"Parasite\" is a feast for the eyes. The film's cinematography, production design, and meticulous attention to detail enhance its storytelling. The stark contrast between the cramped living conditions of the Kim family and the luxurious surroundings of the Park family serves as a visual metaphor for the stark disparities between social classes.\n\nWith its thought-provoking narrative and exceptional craftsmanship, \"Parasite\" has earned its place as a groundbreaking and universally acclaimed film. It received numerous accolades, including the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival and four Academy Awards, including Best Picture, making it the first South Korean film to win that honor. Its success and impact have transcended cultural boundaries, resonating with audiences worldwide and cementing its status as a modern masterpiece.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Parasite\" is a riveting and genre-defying film that combines social commentary, suspense, and exceptional performances to create an unforgettable cinematic experience. Bong Joon-ho's direction, coupled with an outstanding ensemble cast, crafts a powerful narrative that explores the complexities of social class and humanity's relentless pursuit of a better life. \"Parasite\" stands as a testament to the power of cinema to challenge and provoke, leaving an indelible mark on all who watch it.", "Bingo.Is this movie worth watching?

They scrape the internet, live in the basement, and do anything for a job. When you think they are already miserable enough, the movie suddenly turns around: they are not the worst yet, there are even worse ones. If you are rich, there must be someone richer than you; If you are poor, there must be someone even poorer than you. The wealth gap is like countless walls, dividing people into different classes. This wall stands tall even in the wind, sun, and rain, without moving a trace. The Park couple may seem foolish, but they are still getting richer and richer; The Jin Jize family is incredibly intelligent, but they still can't turn around.

Enjoyably thrilling.", "A Darkly Hilarious Dive into Class StrugglesSet in South Korea, Parasite is like a rollercoaster ride through the twisted maze of class divides, where the rich are living it up in their fancy mansions while the rest of us plebs are left scraping by like crumbs on the floor.\n\nThe story follows the Kim family, a bunch of scrappy hustlers who manage to wriggle their way into the lives of the wealthy Park family faster than you can say \"social climbing\". It's like watching a game of cat and mouse, except the cats are wearing designer suits and the mice are pulling off the heist of the century.\n\nNow, I won't spoil the plot twists for you, but let's just say things take a turn for the... well, let's just say they take a turn. And it's not pretty. But what is pretty is the way Bong Joon-ho manages to blend dark humor with biting social commentary like a master chef whipping up a gourmet meal.", "ACT LIKE YOU OWN THE PLACE.You'll watch knowing you're in the hands of a master filmmaker", "What's the real griftThis film is always one step ahead of its audience. You are so in tune with the protagonists that by the time they are neck deep into their futile grift, the question of who's right or who's wrong isn't so much as being poised by the master director Bong Joon-ho; it's being slammed over your head with a rock. And when you recover, and the audience claps, the answer still isn't clear.\n\nParasite is deserving of all the massive praise it has received. That I saw this in a packed theater with an adoring, fully rapt crowd truly warmed my heart. It's cinema at its best.\n\nAs many folks are noting, and I will reiterate: go into this cold! Read as little about it as possible if you can. It will make the experience so much better. This is one I know I will be revisiting often over the years. Enjoy it.", "A superb combination of comedy and tragedy, laugh and cry, joy and sympathyComedy and tragedy, the combination of the two is what a Korean filmmaker really good at, and Bong Joon Ho is no exception. Started with comedy, you'll find yourself laughing and going with the flow as the movie suddenly change its color in the middle of it like you have never expected before: the reality of living in poverty in modern world, where one and one's family (and spouses) can automatically be dehumanized by society, with the same level of rats and cockroaches. The opposite goes for the movie itself, as it humanized itself when the two most tragic characters in the movie got snapped and decided that it's enough. One of the most important movie in 2019. Movies like this need to be produced more, and, if possible, outnumber the high-budgeted, massively-hyped, full-CGI, full-action movies.", "A well deserving oscar win.The way that this film respects its own characters is mind blowing. I really enjoyed watching this movie it's such a brilliant story with brilliant storytelling, it made me laugh cry and be scared in that order.. loved it, definitely gonna watch it again.", "Deserves every single award of it...I already have a good experience of korean movies, and this one has surely been one of my favourite, though to be honest, having a vague idea of what its plot is about when i decided to watch it, i was not that certain of what i could expect since films dealing according to critics and reviews with allegories and social messages always face my instinctive mistrust. Well, these elements are there too, but all slipped and fitted in a very intriguing and solid storyline which though starting as a light, almost comedian style plot, ends up in a bloodshed and furthermore in a very bitter truth, the realworld truth which is too hard to break free from. The film will capture your interest and attention within its first five minutes and this attention will be constantly increasing throughout its duration, a feature rather typical in this kind of stories where a rather insignificant and innocent act leads to a complicated and difficult to deal with situation like in many Cohen brothers films. Taking this in consideration one could say that the twist of this story is not that original after all, however this one, resulting in an escalating complication and a very bitter ending, is really irresistible, and certainly one of the best and most indriguing one you should expect from a movie! P.S Yesterday, global celebration of the Day of Greek language under the motto: \"Do you know you speak Greek?\". So, here's the tip of the day: Did you know that among plenty of others in your own whichever language, the title of this movie too, is actually a 100% greek word?", "epical masterpieceThis film is art. You need a moment to get the scenario but then you are caught in it. It is breathtaking. It's fun and scary, dark and lovely and just sad. This is perfect in every way. This might need to sink in awhile but it is truely a cinegraphic masterpiece.", "Brilliant Dark SatireParasite: A con-artist family preys on an upper-class couple and their children. That's the bare bones of this film but it is a multi-layered black comedy thriller which heaps the satire on with a trowel but never falters as the brilliant script and direction by Bong Joon-ho keeps things going at a brisk canter. A tale of class war as the condescension shown to the servants is all too obvious, there is a line which must never be crossed by the hired help. The way the Kim family inveigle their way into the wealthy Park's home is a joy to observe. First the son as an English tutor then the daughter as an art therapist followed by the father and mother as chauffeur and housekeeper, the existing servants just cast aside. Something odd then happens which would be a spoiler if revealed but it alters the tone of the film. Things proceed towards a dark climax which ventures into the area of quotidian horror. Another masterpiece by Bong Joon-ho which he (partially) based on his own experiences as a maths tutor to the son of a well off family. 9/10.", "Bong Joon's best work till dateThere are many reasons why Korean movies are a top notch and Bong Joon is definitely one of those. This Lynchian styled narrative is surely to take you for a ride. The movie starts with a light hearted tone but gets seriously dangerous with unexpected turns of events. The movie shows off the dark secrets of both rich and the poor and our judgement towards them. It's a confusing perspective for the viewer on who to feel sorry for, which side to take. Excellent!", "SplendidThis is one of the best movies of the new century. All characters are real and to some extent relatable. While the movie is Korean and leverages Korean culture in many parts, the multicultural, universal takes what made this movie so great.\n\nMost importantly, while the movie does make a lot of comments with regards to class differences, it constantly refrains from taking side or lecturing the audience.", "MasterpieceParasite is, if not the best, definitely one of the top 5 movies of 2019. The film is almost perfect in every aspect possible.\n\nBoth the cinematographer Kyung-pyo Hong and the director Bong Joon-ho make an outstanding job with a production design that is off the charts. These three aspects together result in one of the most eye-grabbing movies of the decade. Every shot is, at the same time, beautiful and meaningful, to the point that you could understand the whole movie even if it had no dialogues.\n\nThe screenplay is also one of the strengths of the film. Bong Joon-ho and Han Jin-won came up with a great idea that is as original as it gets and managed to make it funny, interesting, sarcastic, sad and verisimilar. The movie shows the difference between classes like \"Roma\" (2018), but has the rhythm and its core similar to \"Get Out!\" (2017).\n\nEvery character is important and has its moment of protagonism. Due to the complexity and the nuances put in the screenplay, none of the characters is a villain or a hero. The only villains in this story are the unfairness of the capitalistic society and the lack of empathy of wealthy people towards the less resourceful ones.\n\nThe acting by all the main cast is sublime, but the highlights are Kang-ho Song and Yeo-jeong Jo. Kang-ho plays Kim Ki-taek, father of the Kim family. He captures the essence of this experienced man that has gone through a lot in his life and has his pride taken from him in the course of the movie, making his character's arc of development the most interesting of the film. Yeo-jeong plays Yeon-gyo, mother of the Park family. She is the complete opposite of Ki-taek; she's naive and has, and seemingly has always had, an easy life. She's clearly not aware of the things that happen outside her bubble, and that makes her vulnerable to smart people like the Kim family.\n\nLast, but definitely not least, the music. It dictates the current state of the film and manipulates the spectator so you get absolutely fixated on the screen. It has hints of suspense, comedy and even horror.\n\nParasite (2019) is one of the finest movies made in the past decade and, most certainly, deserves a watch. It's eye-grabbing in every sense of the word and really fun to watch, but is also very dense and insightful, providing a vision of how things work that's not usually shown in the mainstream content.", "One of the best script ever!It starts as a high quality comedy movie but things getting change. General look at Parasite, it's true to say that it's kind of horror movie couse' of the main idea. People like Kim family, lives in the real world society and doing \"parasiting\" to other people.

It is already the first Korean film to win the Palme d'Or at the Cannes film festival. This movie was funnier than I was expecting. Set in Seoul, it shows a poor family, the Kims, ingratiating themselves with a rich one, the Parks. The members of the rich family are actually quite decent, although somewhat condescending and gullible, and the Kims are likable rogues. The Kims, consisting of a father, mother, son, and daughter, live in a semi-basement apartment that looks out on an alley where drunks urinate. The father and mother are unemployed, the son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) has failed the entrance exam for the South Korean university system, and the daughter Ki-jung (Park So-dan) has failed to get into an art school. They fold pizza boxes for cash. When a friend (Park Seo Joon) tells Ki-woo that the Park teenage daughter Da-hye (Jung Ji-so) needs a tutor, Ki-woo applies for and, with the help of documents forged by his sister, gets the job. Then when he learns that the Park toddler son needs an art therapist for a recent traumatic event, Ki-woo recommends his sister, without disclosing that that she is his sister. (The traumatic event that the boy suffered becomes important later.) With the help of Google, she bluffs her way into obtaining the position. Then Ki-jung figures out how to get the Park family chauffeur fired, and the Kim father Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho) gets the job. Using the cook/housekeeper's (Lee Jung Eun) peach allergy, they manage to get her fired as well, and the Kim mother Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin) takes her place. By halfway through the film, the Parks are employing all four of the Kims without knowing that they are members of the same family.

To tell more would spoil the pleasures of this deliciously demented parable on class, greed, prejudice and more. As expected from a Bong Joon-ho film, the tone boldly changes at will (mostly between hysterical satire and nerve-wracking thriller), but the transitions are more fluid than ever before for the talented filmmaker--or perhaps it's just because the story and technique is so gripping. Meticulously designed and flawlessly performed by its cast (the first foreign-language group to ever score the ensemble cast award from the Screen Actors Guild), its audacious tangle of ideas and statements packaged with artful, precise elegance. Some of the metaphors come off as shopworn in their exactness, but the film is so otherwise ingeniously constructed that it takes effort to recall in the aftermath exactly how the incidents all piled up.

Screenplay is amazing, I think it is best original screenplay of 2019 next to Knives Out. It takes you inside of it at the beginning and then you can never leave. Cast made an incredible job.

It starts slow, there are subtitles, but you are quickly adapted to the the films rhythym. I know nothing of this culture but it is a story of humans The loyalty and love we share in our family. Choices are made, levers tripped, situations develop... Both families are endearing. There are some light and humorous scenes. There are also a few 'oh come on' risks akin to a sitcom, but that's how we get from there to 'holy crap what is happening here' so must take that leap with the director.

Seemingly innocuous, \"Parasite\" captures the lively trials of the Kim family as they scheme and trick their way into cushy employment, starting an invasion of sorts. The web of lies in an escalating con targeting the insensitive and gullible Park family opens a series of mouth watering doors, but alas, there's always some that should remain shut.\n\nWhether it's borders, classes, or smells, everyone has a line, that once crossed, destroys most semblance of rationale. \"Parasite\" brilliantly dissects how these boundaries (however personal and subjective) are developed within our very complicated and unique species.\n\nFilmed almost exclusively within the two families' domiciles, one a filthy, cramped basement apartment, the other a glorious, spacious and meticulously spotless mansion on the hill, \"Parasite\" offers an obvious and very deep class chasm as plot kindling.\n\nDelicious absurdist touches like peach fuzz allergies, hammer throw expertise, American Indian infatuations, and wifi signal hunting, are peppered throughout offering much welcomed distraction. Spinning an endearing class dichotomy comedy wildly out of control adds white knuckle power to the jarring second act. Sides are drawn early on, making it is easy to cheer for the bottom feeders in this warfare, but not everything on screen is black and white. The consequence of action and reaction during the increasingly muddied grey areas powers this film. What is good? What is evil? How is that line drawn?\n\nSneaky, powerful, perfectly paced, funny, shocking, and quite wonderful. Can a film be both dark and bright? Yes, yes it can.\n\n\nhipCRANK", "Great story!

At the 77th Golden Globe Awards, the film won the award for Best Foreign Language Film. It received four nominations at the 73rd British Academy Film Awards. It also became the first non-English film to win the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture.\n\nThe film's title \"Parasite\" was selected by Bong as it served a double meaning, which he had to convince the film's marketing group to use. Bong said \"Because the story is about the poor family infiltrating and creeping into the rich house, it seems very obvious that Parasite refers to the poor family, and I think that's why the marketing team was a little hesitant. But if you look at it the other way, you can say that rich family, they're also parasites in terms of labor. They can't even wash dishes, they can't drive themselves, so they leech off the poor family's labor. So both are parasites.\"\n\nI read Director and script writer Bong Joon is a great admirer of Alfred Hitchcock and I'm sure Hitch would praise this movie even the music score is reminiscent of Hitchcock films . The film makes several nods to Alfred Hitchcock throughout. Stairs are used as a motif, voyeurism is used as characters watch scenes through windows 14 times, and (most obviously) there is a brief glimpse of an out of place Alfred Hitchcock collection in the Park's home. I thought it also reminded me of Quentin Tarantino in its dark comedy and there are some very funny moments especially in the first half of this unique and original film.\n\nUnfortunately I've only seen Parasite on DVD but I hope to see it again on a Cinema Screen soon. It's a movie I want to watch again as it's as good as all the hype it's getting and what a journey! it takes the audience on. Described as a Black Comedy Thriller as of 2/2/20 this film had grossed a Worldwide $163.3 million and was estimated to have cost $11 million to produce.\n\nOf course I don't know any of the actors but they're all terrific in their roles and as an ensemble cast one of the best this year . I still think it's odd to include this film in 2 Best Film Categories at next weeks Academy Awards it had no chance of winning Best Picture but I'm certain it will win Best International Feature Film and it probably deserves to. I'm still so fond of Pedro Almod\u00f3var's Pain & Glory..\n\nPs an add on comment after seeing Parasite on a Cinema screen the best way to appreciate a film like this.\n\nAfter seeing Parasite on a Cinema Screen at last I appreciate the movie even more. There's so much to absorb and think about in the layers of Pasasite. The story depicts Class divides, Climate Catastrophes, Nuclear War fear and Violence due to mental illness and resentment. I was wrong in my first review to think Parasite had no chance of Winning Best Film of the year and I still think it's unfair that films in a Foreign Language have 2 bites of the Best Film cherry but this movie is a great film .\n\nThis is not a new review my original will do but just an observation after seeing \"Emma\" this week which portrayed Upper Class 19th Century snobbery and class division then the excellent HBO series \"Succession \"portraying an incredibly wealthy Media magnates family living a life of incredible privilege financed by greed and cunning plotting the next coup. The common thread that Parasite, Emma and Succession have is total separation from the feelings and aspirations of anyone outside their Class it's survival at all costs and disregard anyone who smells differently speaks differently, dresses differently or anyone doesn't process a degree or wealth. The poor family's ingenious scheme to obtain a better life regardless of the outcome shows more intelligence and hope to improve their situation than the insular, neurotic self obsessed rich Park family.\n\n2 comments from Parasite said by Ki-taek and wife Chung-sook stay in my mind .\n\nKi-taek: They are rich but still nice. Chung-sook, Ki-taek's wife: They are nice because they are rich.\n\nChung-sook, Ki-taek's wife: If I had all this I would be kinder.\n\nKi-taek: Rich people are naive. No resentments. No creases on them. Chung-sook, Ki-taek's wife: It all gets ironed out. Money is an iron. Those creases all get smoothed out by money.\n\nBoth families end up with creases and resentments in Parasite so I guess both families fit the definition of Parasites-\n\nparasite\n\nLearn to pronounce noun 1. an organism that lives in or on an organism of another species (its host) and benefits by deriving nutrients at the other's expense.", "It's clearly a 10/10Masterpiece, no cgi, no Michael Bay, extraordinary story, social critical. It'll make you think about your position as a viewer of the movie in a cinema, after you've watched it. 10/10 + Oscar", "Finally getting some recognitionBeen some years now that I've been watching Korean Movies. Been trying my best to let friends know about how amazing some of them can be but with no luck, the language barrier and the different culture is enough to put off most from even trying. I'm glad I've sticked to it though. Old Boy was my introduction to korean movies, but Memories of Murder is what kept going back for more. Through MM I got to discover Kang Ho Song, who I personally think is an amazing actor, wont be exaggerating if I had him in my top 5, of which Al Pacino is #1. As for Parasite, dont need me to tell you that this is a gem of a movie that can't be missed, even if this is your first time venturing into korean cinema.", "Awesome filmLess subtle but much more embodied depiction of social class at where each class lives. A Twist in the second half of film. Dark, funny, thrilling, and thought provoking. This film has all combinations.", "If this wasn't named \"Parasite\" I'd be running to the theater to watch this.The problem is that the Koreans and Japanese and other people from that side of the world make so many disturbing movies that I just don't watch them. Now the name of this movie is \"Parasite\" and that doesn't fill me with confidence. But I've been assured that this is not a disturbing movie so I'll go give it a chance. But the one thing I have to say, only in America can a foreign language film win best picture in the greatest award ceremony of the year.", "As Stakes Rapidly Rise, a Clever Family of Con Artists Slips UnderwaterA relatively simple, low-key racket spirals way out of control as an impoverished lower class Korean family smoothly weasels their way into the lives of a wealthy, naive, white collar household.\n\nUnpredictably composed, Parasite effortlessly shifts between several genres, evenly mixing comedy with tragedy and several stops in between. Of the versatile tools in that particular box, the film's at its best on the frequent occasions that it ratchets up the tension. I constantly caught myself holding in a deep breath, completely immersed in the moment and conflicted about the best possible outcome. Not all of those nail-biters lead to fireworks, and the film is careful not to overplay its hand, so that, when the time is right, those inevitable explosions land like a flurry of unexpected body blows.\n\nThe first hour is captivating, as the leeches' shady plot comes together and their long con gains momentum, but the home stretch, with its string of sharp curves and grim consequences, is unrestrained chaos in the best of ways. One helluva ride.", "Bong Joon Ho Directs another WinnerBong Joon Ho directed one of my favorite movies of 2017, Okja, and has done it again in 2019 with Parasite. A working class family worms their way into the lives of a wealthy family with unexpected results. Ho has written a sardonic satire which loses nothing in translation from Korean to English. Koreans, like we American counterparts, have a 99% and a 1% who look down on the rest of us with disdain. The script is right on point and the entire cast is excellent. Easily one of the ten best films of 2020.", "Well....I didn't expect 'that' after the first half. That's for sure!(Flash Review)\n\nWOW! I did not see all that coming. The film sets the stage with this severely lower class family who live in a crappy garden apartment who hatch a plan to fake their way into a wealthy family's life to feed off them like parasites. They are doing real services but under a false guise while earning the family's trust. With ample tension and drama there, the film then shifts up a gear with a surprise revelation about the previous housekeeper. Topping that, the film shifts into high gear with a wild grand finale. The story was original, well-written and semi-believable with twists that don't cheat the viewer. Complimented by great cinematography and editing made the film gripping and captivating. This film can be analyzed from several angles and is aptly named so watch, enjoy, ponder.", "MasterworkIt is demonstrably an excellent film within the first 15 minutes and it gets better. It has a very good script, one which is honed with good characterization and motive, together with fine structural exposition. No other script in the 2020 Oscars has the qualities that this one has in terms of writing skill.\n\nIn terms of execution, the directing and other technical components, all coalesce brilliantly. It is probably the editing too where so many remarkable films excel that lifts the film again. The sequences in the house between the families are memorable here as the tension is raised with so much at stake.\n\nThe story has many layers which are relevant to this time: chiefly inequality, but also other themes too which are touched on in deft ways and through the characters so as to move the story along toward its rather terrible conclusion. The ending is somewhat classical; a purge clarifies the entire drama, and it is effective in its own terms, but it also the only part of script that is not entirely ideal. Other choices might have been made which do not make the one we see an error.\n\nSignalling 'wokeness' is pointless with this film. It is a very good film and will be referenced by film makers and students for years to come. That durability is honor indeed.", "Among the best films of this decade!If Memories of Murder did not solidify Mr. Bong's place as one of this century's greatest artists, then this film certainly did. I cannot remember the last time I saw a film this great in theaters. By a full 1.5 stars, this film has replaced Once Upon a Time in Hollywood as my favorite film of 2019. Of course, that is subject to change, but I can't see this being beat any time soon.\n\nParasite is a film about which I think I should say as little as possible. Knowing nothing about the plot going in was a great benefit. The film has so much to say about class, about wealth, about family, about society. It is all so focused and direct. The movie never meanders or wanders off to other topics. It is excellently paced and has fantastic editing. The script is so well-written, both in terms of dialogue, progression of the plot, set-up and payoff, reincorporation, and commentary. The film looks fantastic, as most of this director's other pictures do. The music is pretty great, very well timed and sometimes used for comedic effect. The acting is great, too. Song Kang-Ho is great as usual, but the younger actors and the women do great as well. I especially loved Jo Yeo-Jeong's performance. I think watching this in theaters is definitely worth it if you can manage.\n\nI loved this movie. I think it is a pretty accessible foreign film. My showing was pretty full, and the next two showings were sold out entirely.
