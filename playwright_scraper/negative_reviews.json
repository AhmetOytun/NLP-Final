Don't except anything exciting or interesting. The plot is easy to see through and they fail miserably to create any emotional connection with the audience.", "Made with a deft handHow can we take insignificant uninteresting stuff and make it awesome stuff because this flick has loads of characters and you may or may not like the premise of the jeweled glove and having to stop Thanos' destruction. Do you like that premise? To make awesome from awesome is something but un awesome into awesome something else to do. First the bad is it has too much melodrama with faces filling the screen in different emotive expressions to bring more \"important\" to everything. It's like the Looney Tunes episode of opera singing with Bugs, Elmer Fudd, wearing helmets with little wings, and a fat white horse, the type that of helmet that Thor wears too. Never into this episode because I like FUN. Or like the symbol of acting, the frowning face and the smiling face so I get there's an audience for this that I'm not for. The other thing is referencing other movies in here. Some of the references people might not even like, numerous time traveling flicks mentioned, Hot Tub Time Machine, Terminator, BTTFuture, Time Cop, Bill and Ted, even in Cap: Civil War I recall Empire Strikes Back which I thought the same thing but didn't think there would be way more in this movie by the makers, as some may not even like some of those movies. This isn't a tv show, but a movie, it sounds like something people you're around would say, not actual characters in the movie. Thirdly there's too much sentimental domestic stuff rearing itself with too much \"family\" shyt , little kid crap, YAWN. This was a problem in Captain Marvel in the mid part in some shack remeeting an over emoting lady friend and her tyke, I was expecting Cap Marvel to present some tampons to her to ease her, or even the Skrulls wearing sweaters to make it cuter. These are space warriors in the comics, for Pete sakes. This is off the top of my head. In Endgame what I'm talking about is perfectly shown in one scene out of nowhere this happens: this guy is sitting on a front porch (I get he's from Iron Man but others may not have seen that) and his tyke says she wants cheeseburgers. \"You can have all the cheeseburgers you want, cheeseburgers, all of them,\" paraphrased, while spacing out having a sedated appearance, and this just cuts to another different scene. What the?!?!?? Geezers sitting on front porches, thanks movie. This encapsulates why this domesticated crap is crap.\n\nNow the good stuff is this is funny af (af acronym was actually on some billboard recently kid you not) moments from Thor, a delightful chap, who's taken the spotlight a lot recently after being in the shadow in the early MCU, the opening scenes from Guardians is reshown from a diff perspective of like Starlord doing the same walkman listening and miming motions while the current superheroes spying on him hilariously. The revisiting of other Marvel movie scenes kind of work like from Thor: Dark World, Avengers 1, Cap: Winter Soldier. Dark World domestic scene works because it's around palace intrigue and I like the vibrance of that movie being the first MCU movie I saw. And also the elevator scene from Winter Soldier is reduxed in a funny way, and the Battle of NY from Avengers 1 also. The other thing is a fight sequence between Thor, Cap, Iron Man against Thanos which is impressive wow. It's here that it also shines. I think these other MCU scenes with a different spin are kinda cool, although I would have liked just to introduce its own thing this movie. I mean you don't see in Avengers 1 them resisting scenes from their solo movies. I know that they want to get this Thanos storyline out of the way though naturally and the whole story is just like the comics pretty much verbatim. Personally I'm ambivalent about that storyline frankly. I actually appreciate the movies that takes an insignificant plot and make something out of it.\n\nBut you know the good thing is these movies present loads of interviews, panel conferences, and those global cast events that are so entertaining to watch so ti's a win win. Wondering what is the key to happiness for all of those in those interviews. In Fractured Fairytales they say \"the happiest people are busy people\" but that's not quite, it's those who value their masculine and feminine (guys former and women latter obv.) It seems the doorways just open for those type of people, and the busy people-an illusion. I've worked so much and study and the doorways , are they flying open. It's these in these interviews, Scarlett who knows how to be feminine, Brie has a slight masculine to her and you see why people are like what the?? Cap Marvel movie people are not taken with that, it takes place like 2 decades ago and now men have to sit in theater who were around then and have to watch this smarmy lady onscreen, what does this tell you. Gwyneth Paltrow is another masculine, why is she here, the song in stores \"turn your magic on/I feel alive again\", you like that? She was with that guy until he's like no I don't want to deal with this masculine person I just want to make more songs forget this. I don't know the correlation between busy and this m/f thing I just know if you are too much in one it's OK to balance it out with the other thing to keep fun. I j/o every other day. Anyway so the movie has Thor hammer it up, Hulk smashes, Hawkeye lays some serious deep stick arrow, Black Widow looks spiderific, Iron Man unleashes blasts, and Cap just goes in raw.", "THIS IS WHAT DOCTOR STRANGE WAS ON ABOUT?

This movie is 2 and a half hours of weak plot, little script, visually unappealing CGI, bad acting, and continuous violence.\n\nThe only person in this movie who had acting skills was Robert Downy Junior. Benedict Cumberbatch was so insufferable that it's shocking that he's the same person who starred in The Imitation Game, which is one of the best movies I've seen this decade.\n\nThe entire last hour was nothing but fighting, killing, and brutal violence. I honestly don't understand how they can get away with rating movies with this much murder PG-13, when movies with significantly less violence and murder, like John Wick and The Hitman's Bodyguard, are rated R. Apparently our backwards society has deemed that killing and violence is an acceptable thing for children to be exposed to, but hearing the word Fvck will traumatize them for life.\n\nWith the exception of Robert Downey Junior, the way the people talked reminded me of 11th grade English class when we would read Shakespeare aloud in class.

Also, I would definitely NOT take kids to see this, as the movie has a very dark and disturbing atmosphere to it.", "Worst movie EverWhy did the producers have to keep the plot quiet till the end? Because it sucked! My kids love the Avengers, but I have since deleted all DVR recordings of them after watching this! Who in the world gave these jokes for producers money to destroy a franchise? Idiots!", "Not a very good movieThe main reason i'm giving this movie 1/10 is because this one doesn't deserve the current rating that it has(at the moment of writing this is 8.6, I would refer to other current movie ratings at the moment of writing this review). A rating of 8.6 means that this movie is as good as The matrix(8.7), Saving private Ryan(8.6), Memento(8.5), Interstellar(8.6) and also that it is better than Mr. Nobody(7.9) and Synecdoche, New York(7.5), etc.\n\nThis is the result of a movie with lots of fans who don't have any idea how to rate a movie and usually haven't seen much. at the most I would give this movie a 5.3, it is not so bad and it's enjoyable not memorable. Too many jokes and this is not a comedy, it doesn't seem to have a script not giving a chance for the actors to actually act.\n\nIn the movie they combine cinematography of some of the other movies related to this franchise, so in some instances the quality drops really low to the point you feel as if you're watching a really bad TV series, most CG effects are on point and sometimes not(the hulk buster).\n\nI personally don't understand who would give a score of 10/10 or 9/10 so easily to a movie no one will remember next year.", "No Spoiler Alert -But HATED The EndingOkay, plenty of action, lots of humor, excitement galore...so why the 1 rating from me? Because, and I'm not telling you one word about how it ends, this has to be the WORST way to end a movie I've ever seen...and wished I hadn't. The heck with it. Guess who won't be lined up to see how the next one goes? That would be ME 'cause frankly, at this point, I don't care.", "2 and a half hours of my life I can't get backWho wants to go to a movie when they feel worse at the end than they do when they come in?

I can't believe all the high ratings.", "Not even an average 5, no way 8+Avengers: Infinity War getting anything above a 6 ratings destroys my faith in IMDB's rating system. Once I got past the first page of 10/10 ratings, the rest were 1, 2 and a few miscellaneous 5's. Four of us sat down to watch this movie last night and only two of us could finish it. I apologized for renting it and threw IMDB's ratings system under the bus. I kept waiting for something redeeming to happen, but it never did. The countless times I said, \"Well, that was stupid\" went on through the entire movie. Plot holes, lazy writing or whatever you want to call it were just constant. I will not wait through another 2+ hour movie in this series hoping for something redeeming to happen. Oh, and taking the red, white and blue away from Captain Am.., wait, what's his name again? Steve somebody. No, I'm done and whatever gaming of the IMDB ratings went on makes it of less use too.", "You can skip this oneI am not a fan.

Wether it's shapeless, explosive, dripping, ludicrous or misleading, it always ends with the feeling that there could have been more. But even if you try harder for another minute, there's only void.

Like 2.5 hours weren't enough to include an ending, so you have to wait for the movie industry's next release, obviously next year (as usual) to see what you were supposed to see on this movie.\n\nWatch the movie if you want to watch for 2.5 hours a completely uninspired, unintelligent and boring plot, been written by a group of writers who obviously were bored themselves in their personal lives, with all usual cliche and banal lines, a film that has nothing to say, and doesn't worth a dime either as fantasy, as science fiction as drama, or comedy. If you add them all, the sum is zero.\n\nOf course, you get a parade of popular actors that participate and serve that worth-less movie, and a series of computer effects. But a film is much more than actors and effects, it is supposed to have essence, inspired messages and stories that worth the time you spend watching, otherwise it's just an effects demo. You can watch many special effects demos on YouTube, on the cinema you are supposed to see a movie, not a demo.

This review applies to every marvel movie ever made.\n\nWhy I hate marvel movies Marvel represents everything wrong with movies from this generation .The marvel universe started off strong in 1944 with captain America which for the time was incredible. Than they started making movies that were aimed at adults such as the Blade trilogy and of cause the punisher which might I add I actually enjoyed. But than the sequels began to this day in 2018 marvel have filmed over 80 movies with an average of 9 movies every 2 years. If this doesn't show marvels true intentions than I don't know what will. Marvel is the most soulless repetitive money motivated film company of all time at this point you are literally paying for the same movie with a different repetitive costume 80 times 5 times a year. let's say you pay $10 for a ticket for every hardcore fan they have wasted $800 of there money times that by about 20 million fans you got $1600000000 going to a terrible franchise that just keeps ripping people off over and over. Than using money and theatre time that could be going to actual good movies. For example Quentin Tarantino's the hateful 8 was postponed for a later released because non other than marvel desided that they wanted to release there film a few weeks earlier. If movies watchers keep supporting these high budget plotless pointless repetitive garbage movies that keep Dwayne Johnson and marvel in business in a few years there won't be any good movies being made. Than we will all be thinking back to the 90s and mid 2000s when movies weren't money making trash and actually had plots and were more than a few good action sequences wondering what happened. The fact that avengers infinity wars is 49th place on the top 250 is disgusting and shows how close we are to the good movie irreversible apocalypse. There are a few good directors left and unfortunately they are getting old and only release 1 movie per few years such as Quentin Tarantino Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg. But lucky for us it's not to late just stop buying tickets and merchandise for marvel DC and any pointless action or dumb Adam sandler or Amy Schumer comedy and we might be able to save this planet from the great film Death.", "Badest movie ever!Story is scandalous. Too much heroes... you know what I mean.

I understand this is part one of a multi part movie, but *explative* after a hard day I wanted to be 'entertained' not pulled into a depression.. negative from start to finish, nothing but bad feelings. Superhero's are supposed to give hope and you'll find NONE here. In this day and time we live in the entire point of watching a superhero movie to see what a super hero is supposed to do. This movie infuriated me because it did the opposite.. you blew it marvel.. not as mad since I got to see it for free, but angry enough that I won't ever give you a red cent of mine again so long as I live for doing that to me.. you failed me at a time when I wanted nothing but a little entertainment, if I want something depressing that looks like fantasy I just watch the news.

I couldn't find anything, so I looked to purchase a movie from one of the digital movie streaming websites. I looked on on THIS movie database (because I used to trust it), and with a score of 8.6 and so many initial 10/10 reviews, I went against my better judgement and purchased the digital copy of Avengers: Infinity War for \u00a313.99. That's the last time I trust THIS movie database!\n\nI felt hoodwinked, and most definitely conned. This morning I had another look at the reviews, and observed that after the initial 10/10s, the rest of the reviews were 1/10. In retrospect, whilst this website perpetuates itself as having integrity in its reviews/ratings, it is my opinion that it is little more than a mechanism for generating sales for movies that under normal word-of-mouth conditions would tank. I feel so angry with myself.\n\nThe movie itself is a mish-mash of many different themes, and tries way too hard to be serious. I don't watch these movies for that - if I want serious, I'll watch Heat, Goodfellas or any other number of good thrillers. Why oh why would Marvel screw with the feel good formula of 'Guardians of the Galaxy'?\n\nTo sum up, it is my opinion that Avengers: Infinity War should have failed, but didn't - largely due to the manipulation of reviews and information. And I doubt very much if this interference of information was made for free!\n\nIf you believe the Avengers are a real, you might actually like this movie - everyone else will likely feel a little low. And to be honest, who needs that in this day and age? If you want to watch some misery, save your money and watch the news instead!", "It's all for the moneyVery angry after watching this movie. It's a trend, started by Netflix, now Marvel also sees a good money making formula to force people and Marvel fans to keep watching and buying the stuff. The formula is this: make a (potential) good storyline, use good actors and great cgi but then make an open end, ready for a sequel. I'm sorry but then there is no real satisfaction after watching the movie. Normally (especially) Marvel movies end well, the good guys win, the bad guys loose. In the old days you get a good feeling and have 2 hours of good entertainment. You can replay the movie back in your head and repeat that good feeling. No not any more, all for the money, more more, make (force) the people longing for the next episode. I'm ok with that with series, but NOT for movies. Movies need to have a satisfactory good end. That is why you watch 2.5 hours of movie. It's that I could watch this for free with friends, but in a cinema I would demand my money back. What would people say if you buy a book and there is no end, you need to buy another book for the end, it's the same thing. So that is why I rate this movie a 1, even though all my favorite Marvel characters are in, lot's of humor, super CGI and everything looks great for a 10 rating, until the last few minutes. It really ruin everything before it back to the lowest rating. Oh and please, it has nothing to do with that \"I don't understand\" the movie. I understand the financial reasons for doing this very well!", "Infinity War? No, infinitely disappointing. Don't waste your time!When I started watching this seemingly endless drag of a movie, I was expecting some of the magic that this franchise has had in the past. It wasn't to be. Instead, we got familiar character after familiar character, each doing their characteristic throw-away joke.\n\nNo drama was involved; at no time did I ever think any of the far-too-many stars that were involved were in any danger, or that anything bad could happen; it was all slight-of-hand, all CGI trickery that looks impressive when there's just a bit of it. Here were great heaping glops of it. Acting? None that I could discern, it was all throw-away lines from throw-away characters. These cardboard characters looked better on the cardboard box!\n\nAt first I thought of giving this piece of garbage a score of 2/10; but really, this movie is so very bad, and so damaging to the franchise, that a 1/10 is well deserved. It would be lower if I could make it so. This is a throw-away movie.\n\nVery young children and the extremely easily impressed by green-screen effects may like this film, but don't look for a plot or story; it's got lots of familiar faces though. It would have done so much better if it had a decent script-writer!

Characters blowing up and running around at the same time. Is it possible I have become overstimulated by this type of adolescent entertainment?

It tells us as much about what prison is really like as Pretty Woman tells us about what prostitution is really like. People like fairy tales, so both these movies were very popular.", "An \"O.K.\" Movie, Worshiped Because of It's Accessibility.Shawshank Redemption has been elevated in popular opinion to the status of masterpiece because of one irrefutable virtue. It is accessible. Regrettably, as is true in so many cases, popular opinion is an inaccurate gauge of this picture's actual quality. The reason this film has attained its current level of acclaim is that it is impossible to misinterpret its theme or message, impossible to be offended by it, impossible to be confused by. However, as this review should show, it is entirely possible to be unimpressed by \"Shawshank.\"\n\nThe story of Shawshank Redemption is something I might expect if I was being pitched a script by middle schoolers. The complex coincidental frameup, the daring escape, the clear cut definitions of good and evil. the timeless friendship finally and uneventfully consummated on a beautiful shoreline. Each step more unsurprising than the last, each beat more clich\u00e9d that the last. Every time the filmmakers feel like building tension or revealing something about the characters, they take the most obvious road. This might be excusable if the road didn't also lead to the most obvious destinations.\n\nPeople also praise the acting in the film. While it isn't at all bad, it's hard to be impressed when the actors are playing such simplistic roles. Stereotypes when acted well are still boring.\n\nI sincerely hope that over time, when the film has settled into history and once people are more able to set this pandering film along side its heavily plundered predecessors, it will become clear that it offers nothing new, and that what it does offer it doesn't even offer all that well.", "ClicheThis film is nothing but one cliche after another. Having seen many of the 100's of prison films made from the early 30's to the 50's, I was able to pull almost every minute of Shawcrap from one of those films.\n\nWhile it is visually well made and acted, the story has every plot point of the \"standard\" prison film. They have the evil warden, innocent main character, friendly guilty guy, thugs and one good old prisoner. Don't waste your time on this one. Rent or buy some of the classic's of the prison genre.", "unoriginal prison movieThere are some things in this life we will never understand... How did the universe begin? What happens to our souls when we die? How did a movie as bland as The Shawshank Redemption become so overrated?\n\nIn the case of certain other movies, I can at least understand the reasons why they're overrated. But The Shawshank Redemption is so... average. And clich\u00e9-ridden. The film's moral is basically that hope is important, and there's nothing wrong with that in itself. Heck - I have no problem with simplicity. The problem is when you move past the simple and into the land of the simplistic. The movie treats its borrowed plot parts (Count of Monte Cristo, anyone?) and banal themes as though they were freshly minted nuggets of wisdom. (I wouldn't be complaining if it didn't pretend to be anything more than a pleasant diversion.) However, it is with its very last shot that the movie reveals its true condescending colours. If it had ended moments earlier instead, with that poetic shot of the sea, I would have had some respect for it (that's where the superior original story ends). But no, the director had to spell things out for his audience. Frank Darabont knows how to tell a story. He just doesn't know how to tell one with any originality or depth.\n\nThe movie is partially redeemed by three things. The majestic cinematography, the powerful score, and most of all, Morgan Freeman, one of the very best actors working today.\n\nAs for my rating, yes I'm one of those jerks who gives a movie a 1 just to lower it on the top 250.

I can't believe that people like this movie so much. Yes I am biased, I really don't like Tim Robbins but he has made a decent movie or two but this ain't one of them. This is your basic prison movie. What can I say- it has the host of usual characters. The storyline is basic, the outcome I won't say but it is just stupid to say that this is a great movie. I didn't think it was realistic at all and anybody who falls for this crap is either delusional or needs some brains to differentiate between an Edsel and a Lamborghini. I wouldn't watch this movie again unless I was paid to do so. One viewing is enough for this predictable laugher.", "Didactic and overlongAnother one of those overlong morally right-on movies that never rises above average - saved only by the acting.\n\nIts bleeding-heart politics 'dignity of individual maintained in adverse conditions' is played-out well enough but actually lacks any real dramatic tension.\n\nDufrane is a two-dimensional character who seems to go through the drama by numbers - there's never any doubt that he will triumph in the end, it's only a matter of how.\n\nTim Robbins has done many more interesting films than this one - try The Player or Bob Roberts if you're looking for drama/moral ambivalence and how they interact.\n\nBasically, there are a lot better prison films than this one - Jailhouse Rock for starters.\n\nLike most Stephen King stories - quite prosaic. There was a story in here somewhere but it got over-inflated and somewhat lost along the way.\n\nOne to watch on a rainy day when there's nothing better to do.", "The plain & simple truth. It doesn't deserve to be at #2.just read the title. Tough I think it's a pretty decent movie (but not as good as the Stephen King's novel) i just can't understand why it should deserve to be ahead of everyone else in the top 250 (with the exception of the godfather). To be honest i don't even really think it should be in the top 250. Yeah, I know you Americans love the happy-ending Vaseline-flavored subtly homosexual jail movies, but all this hype it's too much anyway. Come on, this can't be better than Welles, Kubrick, Kurosawa or Scorsese (or not even Carpenter and Fulci in my humble opinion) So I give it a 1/10. This is not a critical valuation of the movie. This is a political statement.", "A good movie but definitely not #2 of all timeThis is certainly a good movie, with universal themes of freedom and adversity etc etc, but... I've seen plenty of movies which were more artfully made than this one. There is nothing revolutionary in the directing. The novella by Stephen King is practically tailor-made for a movie adaption, and it seems any capable director could have made a good movie from it. I think the only reason this movie is #2 on this list is the sheer amount of people who have seen it and voted. The other truly great movies near the top of the list don't pack the same mass audience appeal that Shawshank Redemption does, nor are they shown on TNT 6-10 times a year. Movies like 2001, The Seven Samurai, or Lawrence of Arabia, for example, would bore many of the people who love Shawshank Redemption, and I personally consider those three I named and many others to be far better creations than the Shawshank Redemption. Perhaps we should take a poll of TNT viewers on the best movie of all time - I'd bet Shawshank Redemption would place first, with The Blues Brothers coming in a close second.", "A sociopath prison warden, sadistic guard as well as cuddly and misunderstood inmates.Shawshank Redemption is overrated. It's a decent, above average film, but by no means a great film.\n\nThe inmates are pretty much likeable, while the warden and his pet guard are monsters. Also as Freeman's character says: \"You know that everybody in here's innocent?\" As the story develops you feel like he is right, the only criminals are the ones guarding the prisoners.\n\nThis is a sentimental piece made to stir the emotions, but not to stir them too much. Just enough to make the viewer feel there is injustice in the world but that in the end everything ends well and justice surely comes to he who waits 20 years or so for it.\n\nThe Shawshank Redemption is, as I said, a decent film, possibly among the top five films of 1994. IMO the best films of 1994 are Pulp Fiction and L\u00e9on.", "Sugary sentimental and unsatisfyingThis drama has been widely vaunted as one of the best films ever made- personally I just can't see the appeal. Sure it contains very good performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman- but there have been other, much better screen performances by other actors. There is very little suspense or originality about the plot and nothing that hasn't been seen or done on screen a hundred times before. So why the popularity? It's a formulaic feel-good movie who's happy ending is never in doubt. Knowing that Stephen King wrote the novel on which the film was based would probably give that away anyway.

Really what the film is saying is neither profound nor original, and is not to my mind worth saying in the first place at least not at such length- ie life is hard, people suffer, but through struggle the human spirit will win through, learn to make friends and get their deserved reward - mmm. Nothing makes any of the characters real, and the actors are not helped by this terrible overloaded narration which applies a great weight on the story which cannot breath as every moment is made to seem sooo significant. It is not just that there is no lightness of touch in the direction, or that there is no humour, it is that there is a sense that what is being described is more important than humour, or than the real nature of friendship.

The sphere that is created in The Shawshank Redemption is meek whereas the sphere that is created in Escape from Alcatraz is thrilling and you can really feel the tension in the prison.

Fairy tales are beautiful and deep, with complex motives transmitted throughout the centuries, the traditional good-bad dichotomy and a clear moral conclusion. The Shawshank Redemption is dull, with some basic and carefully explained symbolism (because apparently we're too stupid to get it otherwise) and, contrary to traditional notions of morality, the hero's sidekicks are some nice criminals.

It does not come anywhere near the unprecedented standards set by the dark knight or for that matter does not even come close to spiderman 2. The movie is often commended for its humor. In my opinion the humor is extremely dry and futile. Nothing special at all, despite its box office success it would have been better off as an animated movie.

They are just a different caliber of movie no offense to it, its very good. However Al Pacino in both of those films is as close to perfect of a performance as you will ever get. I really feel because it is 35 years old so many people of todays generation has not seen it, I am 20 and own all three and can appreciate the talent by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino in the first film and Al in the second with Francis Ford Coppola directing both.

The story follows to many characters, but not in a way that makes it seem interesting or smart. It can't decide which character it wants to tell the story from. In the novel, the story had many intriguing surprises because it was told through Red's point of view. In the film, the story shows too much of Andy Dufresne and ends up detracting from the story and his development as a character.\n\nEven the music is cliche, uninspiring, and thinks it's much more important than it actually is. In one specific scene, the music ends up draining the scene of all possible emotional weight or significance because it draws attention to itself in a way that it feels more annoying and loud than heartfelt and sincere.\n\nThe color palette is also dull, drab, and lifeless. It only makes viewers want to watch this film less and takes any enjoyment or humor/happiness from the characters away. The acting is also poor and unsubtle. Morgan Freeman has the only few scenes where the acting isn't God-awful. If only the screenplay didn't take out all of the nice, smart, and engaging parts of the novel and replace them with cliche, dull, useless things in the film, this could have been a mildly entertaining/enjoyable watch.\n\nPlease do not watch this film if you haven't already or if you value your time and great cinema.\n\n1/10", "No comment.I was expecting something else entirely to a better movie.

The theme of the film, in two words, is freedom and hope. Indeed, these are the most important concepts in life, but I reviewed this film many times, and with all my desire I could not say after the credits that this movie revealed these words in full. The popularity of this film, or rather not even popularity, but a high rating and high ratings, is primarily due to the herd instinct. That's all.\n\nI do not agree that the theme of freedom should be shown precisely on the example of a prison. It can be shown like this, but then I can't call it brilliant, and the rating obliges me to do it.

They will answer me: 'meaning inner freedom' and all that. But nevertheless, you consider the prison-themed film to be the best film about freedom... The film 'Braveheart' reveals this concept much deeper and more extensively, but the struggle for the freedom of an entire nation is apparently placed lower than this very struggle of a single person.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to emphasize that I am by no means trying to criticize the film as a project.

Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.\n\nI didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, \"Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better.\" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it.

But it fails to satisfy because a Cheeto, no matter how you dress it, is just a Cheeto. The problem is that this movie wants to be two contradictory things that end up canceling each other out. On the one hand, with its superb cinematography, excellent score, and 2 hours and 22 minute runtime, The Shawshank Redemption wants to be epic in scale and make a serious statement about the human spirit. On the other hand, it too wants to be super accessible, with characters straight out of the pages of a comic book, watered down philosophical observations, and impossible to believe scenes, like the one in the prison yard, where the inmates are awestruck by the opera coming out from the PA system as if they were hearing the voice of God himself. Clearly The Shawshank Redemption wants to have its cake and eat it. It wants to be very intellectual but very accessible at the same time. In the end, what you get is something that looks like the real deal, but feels hollow inside, like a Cheeto. The thing is, the world is in love with Cheetos, which are overrated.

I was waiting entire time for the plot to start revolving and when it finally did, the movie was over and left me with a feeling that I've waisted two hours of my life on nothing. For a movie with this high rating I expected to see something fresh and inspirational and somehow it seems to me all the scenes and acting I've seen in this movie I saw a thousand times in bunch of other movies, like it was cliche after cliche. Yawn festival.", "I feel like everyone is brain washedI thought this movie was complete and utter garbage. I don't understand why people liked this movie so much.

Hated it", "MOST OVERRATED AND OVER HYPED FILM OF ALL TIMEThe hype the movie generated did absolutely injustice to the film. The actor did a pretty good job but the screenplay and story is too much boring. The first half its bearable but the last half really let down the film entirely.

It seems that Gotham and its citizens (the entire universe for that matter) only exists to put Arthur down and considering the film isn't told from Arthur's perspective, it is a blatantly stupid depiction of the world. The reason why people liked it so much is because the sad corporate slaves (especially the youth currently being indoctrinated) were subconsciously tricked into believing they were part of some bigger cause when they were really just sitting in their comfy chairs.", "Seen it twice and it still sucksDidn't enjoy this in the cinema and I didn't enjoy it at home. It's not saying anything coherent about how we treat mentally ill people or what a coarse society can do to a person.

Specifically, a mental illness called creative diarrhoea.\n\nSeriously though, there is sooo much wrong with this movie. I won't even start with how I knew that a Joker sob story had no hope of (artistic) success, nor with why I went I went to see it anyway. I'll start by pointing out other reviewers' observation that this is not even the Joker. He's not suave, he's not witty, there are no lethal gimmicks, no morbid jokes, no anarchism, and he isn't a criminal mastermind. He's just a loser that goes off on a school shooter streak.\n\nSecondly, this is not, as I said earlier, a film about mental illness. It is a mockery of it, cashing in on the increasing awareness about mental health. There is not one concept about psychosis or other mental health problems judiciously explored in the movie (an illness which causes the sufferer to laugh in inappropriate situations? Seriously?!). All you're getting here is a downtrodden loner being subjected to beatings and injustices designed to spark indignation in the viewer, then going off on a murder spree.\n\nWith regards to the much-praised acting, it's a mystery to me how anyone could have come to a judgement of Phoenix's theatrical achievement based off such an asinine script, because I can't. Not that you should devote an iota of attention to any of these positive reviews, because I'm fairly confident that there is some large-scale review rigging going on.\n\nThe plot is one dimensional and juvenile, the dialogue as engaging as a monotone nursery rhyme and the character development shallow. There were goofs left right and centre, like revolvers with zero recoil and 8 bullets. Why did Arthur keep dancing? Why did we need to see Arthur fondling himself? Why is he so emaciated? Why so much smoking? I watched so many close-ups of cigarettes burn out it makes me wonder if the film was sponsored by the tobacco industry.\n\nThe two positives in the movie for me were firstly, the final talk show scene, littered though it was with imperfections like the rest of the movie, which did have me sitting a little less slouched in my seat. Also, there were some interesting theories presented tying the Joker with the Batman.\n\nWith the bar set so high by The Dark Knight, no director seeking artistic acclaim will go near the Joker for many years to come, maybe ever, but on the other hand, the Joker character has been rendered a boon for Hollywood opportunists, and this is the second time we've seen the character butchered in a low effort high budget money maker. This one will be forgotten quick, but I don't know how long it will be before the Joker himself recovers.", "Murdering the JokerThis film tries desperately to devillify the most stylish and charismatic villain in the DC universe and excruciatingly transform him into a poster child for mental illness in the most tedious manner possible.. This version of the Joker lacks any semblance of style, luster, flair, or charisma, leaving me to wonder why anyone would bother investing the time and money required to create this turkey, much less watch it.\n\nThey've murdered the Joker for the sake of some social commentary and PC promotion. I don't deny that mental illness is a real issue or that attention should be brought to it, but folks watch movies about supervillians to see super-villainy, not a 2 hour public service announcement. I hung in there as long as I could hoping for this movie to redeem itself, but about 3 quarters of the way through I could take no more of watching it spin it's wheels.\n\nIf you are a fan of the Jack Nicholson or Heath Ledger versions of the Joker then you will likely find this film as painful to watch as I did.", "2 hours full of bad , bad mood.Joaqu\u00edn Phoenix's unconvincing laughing, and looking like a beaten dog had brutaly ennoyed me after 5 minutes.\n\nThe world is mean and bad, and you can only be bad and hit back.

I never got a chance to watch in the theater and I'm very glad I didn't. This movie was 2 hours, that felt like 4, of flat boring plot. Literally nothing happens in the movie. All it is a very mentally ill insecure man talking to a therapist, laughing, and killing people. Arthur's laugh is terrible and annoys me throughout the whole movie. Arthur has no depth or personality. This movie was so boring I started falling asleep. Anyone who things those movie is a deep and meaningful masterpiece clearly has not seen other movies. I can list off so many other movies that are much more moving and deep than this. All this movie does is try to show that the villain, The Joker, from the comics is a distraught weak man. But in reality the joker from the comics is anything but that. He was crazy but a compete mastermind. The 11 Oscar nominations are idiotic because this movie is anything but Oscar worthy.", "No.. Just... no.I'm making sure to give this movie 1 star because it's definitely not a 8.9 - that's a lie.\n\nJoker is not an amazing movie. It's far from great.

What in this movie makes it so different that it deserves a 10? On average, users would review that a 6 or an 8 at max. So i wonder if there hasn't been a scam somewhere telling people: \"Put a ravishing review on Joker and you'll get an iPhone for free!\" The movie is very slow, very repetitive, not surprising, dragging, stupid (Joker seems to be 50 while Bruce is 10 ...

First of all, the real Joker is not a weak and unconfident pushover. Not even in his genesis stage. The real Joker had a high tolerance for pain, could fight and was intelligent. Which made him dangerous due to his insanity. When Joaquin shoots the guy on the subway, he does it out of cowardice. They try to make up for it with the Murray shooting scene. There is no way that Joaquin's Joker will ever fill the shoes of the badass Joker in the comics, not even the different incarnations by different comic authors....and just forget about even coming close to Heath Ledger's portrayal. They should have just called the movie something totally different and forget about trying to make the connection.", "I really don't understand.Joaquin Phoenix is good. The directing is pretty good. The writing is absolutely awful. This movie is trying so hard to be relevant and to have a 'message' that it just throws a jumbled mess of quasi-commentary at you hoping something will stick. It is completely unclear what exactly writer/director Todd Phillips is actually trying to say, if anything. Is Joker a hero of the resistance or is he an incel? Does he go crazy because he's mentally ill or because people are mean to him? Both rich people and poor people are horrible to Joker so what exactly is the class commentary? It's also confusing how Robert De Niro when this movie is clearly ripping off Taxi Driver in many ways, also with a little Mr. Robot thrown in. There's also a subplot with a neighbor that is so incredibly stupid and pointless, which actually has no bearing on the story whatsoever. The movie is also just listless and boring throughout much of it. A movie can be slow-paced without it being boring if interesting things are happening that are driving the plot towards it's conclusion. The only thing driving the story in this movie is knowing that he's going to become joker at some points, not anything that actually happens in the movie. The movie also spends like 5 minutes making fun of a little person for no clear reason. Also for people saying that this movie does a good job saying why you should be nicer to people especially if they're lonely or have mental health issues: firstly you shouldn't need a movie like this to be nice to people, secondly you can make a movie like that where the lonely/mentally ill person doesn't become a murderer since mentally ill people are more likely to be victims than perpetrators of crime, and thirdly if you want a movie showing why you need to empathize with criminals why not movies about all the people of color who have been victims of mass incarceration and were locked up on nonviolent charges instead of a movie about a white male becoming a mass murderer.

This is not a story; it's engineered agony.\n\nThe technical aspects might be good, but it all means nothing if the story's garbage. It's like serving garbage on a golden plate. The plate is beautiful, great craftsmanship, but the garbage is still garbage.\n\nMovies communicate ideas about human life; why did the author think this is a story worth to be told? It preaches madness as a solution for evil. It preaches that self abandonment is the new cool.

What a messed up lesson for life.\n\nThis movie has nothing to offer.", "TediousLabored through until the halfway point (over two days) and gave up. That's an hour of my life wasted. What a depressing, preachy pile of nonsense. I watch movies to be entertained and this movie didn't come close.", "As grotesque as a clown's smileMy husband and I went to see this film and found it extremely depressing. Moreover, everything is caricatured. What could be more normal, you might say, given that it was a depicting the life of a comic book clown? Christopher Nolan, the director of the famous Batman trilogy, said before it was produced that this movie would be useless. Simply because when it comes to horror, the less you show, the scarier it is. If you're told that there is a giant monster in the woods and it eats people, you'll laugh and not believe it or you'll imagine the most horrible monster there is; the most horrible according to you! What others show us is never as horrible for us as what we imagine. Here, to make things really awful, we sink into the worst possible melodrama. As if psychopaths had all been mistreated during their childhood, mocked in adolescence, misunderstood in adulthood without ever having anyone to help them effectively! But no, the vast majority of them were born with a missing bolt in their heads. Something was wrong in them from the start. Here, the director wanted to make us cry by portraying roughly the most cartoonish misery. Everything is in bold capital letters, underlined and highlighted to be sure that we fully understood that the main character didn't have an easy life and that our society is so rotten that we should all revolt and suicide out of desperation or kill each other to put an end to it all. \"Why so serious ? \"asked the Ledger Joker. And that's a good question, because I'm worried about the future of this character, especially for the actors who will want to play him. In terms of the actor's performance, that's Joaquim Phoenix pushed to the extreme all over. In all his films I remember, this actor plays social misfits, loners unable to make friends, depressive people or on the verge of a nervous breakdown, misunderstood guys, sons rejected by their fathers, rebels, etc. In short, he only plays tortured souls. He even played a guy who falls in love with his computer because he can't get along with a real girlfriend. So it's normal that he knows how to play a crazy clown. Talent? If you will, considering the fact that he seems unable to play much else. This simplistic and gloomy depiction of society has already claimed victims. There are people who dress up as clowns and ransack everything in the streets and cinemas where the film is shown. It seems that some misfits wanted to believe that, as with the Joker, their misfortune depended on everything and everyone else. Their happiness couldn't certainly be up to themselves. Anyway, don't believe the good things that are said about this movie. And if you feel a bit out of sorts, don't go to see it, you'll make yourself more unhappy for a film that's really not worth it.", "Extremely disturbing and ImmoralAlright so if you were to ask me about the acting, the performance, the cinematography etc, Joker was good in that. However, the story line was completely messed up and disturbing. The film itself and what they teach you throughout is just wrong, I mean plain wrong! It basically encourages you to \"be the bad guy\" because \"bad stuff happened to u\". Summary: Extremely Disturbing and Immoral", "What a jokeSomething is really wrong with society if that movie is so highly ranked.", "AbusiveCharacters that suffer abuse can be a good element in a plot. But audience should never suffer abuse. The audience needs to experience catharsis in the end. And this never happens with 'Joker'. The film has a huge problem, which it never manages to solve: it wants to be realistic and tell the tale of an innocent, abused individual who snaps; but it also wants to exist within a fictional universe in which this man is as much of an abuser as he is a victim. And this creates problems for the screenwriters that they never manage to solve. Thus Joker comes across as a sympathetic character first, but turns to a vicious killer towards the end, at which point everyone becomes confused, and stops liking him. There is no redemption of any kind, no satisfying emotional resolution, only a brutal ending which serves the purposes of the wider franchise and doesn't deliver on its own terms. In the end, the character we were made to empathize with becomes nothing but a caricature in a silly superhero universe. And that is an insult to anyone who invested in the character from the beginning. The audience is cheated. Also, one should note the disturbing anarchist/communist vibe in the film - the idea that it's better to burn down the world than allow their particular understanding of 'injustice' to go on. I may pity Joker and hate the cynical Wayne, but I won't put degenerate, mentally ill clown in charge of an angry mob that wants to burn everything down.", "Disappointing as alwaysJP has one and only acting register : the depressed looser, I don't understand the critics he is as mediocre as always.

It's too easy, too boring, too shallow.\n\nWhere are the storylines? In all of the above there is none to be found. No plot whatsoever. No rememberable scenes or quotes. Empty. Nada!\n\nIt's even the opposite of a plot: all these movies just don't make any sense. These so-called 'plots' are written in meeting rooms. Bad, bad compromises that only check all the boxes for the laws of Hollywood. And people fall for it.\n\nAnd I just wonder if I'm the only one who thinks: 1. Joker is a joke 2. Hollywood is a joke 3. Review systems are a joke\n\nThis makes me realize it's not just in the cinema that people let themselves be fooled. Think about elections.\n\nAnd this review will be trolled as well. Keep thinking for yourselves guys!", "Hype for no reasonI made an imdb account after watching this movie. It was that terrible. Watching Joaquin Phoenix do interperative dance and try really hard to play an effeminate mentally ill person. The change into the Joker never felt earned. The movie itself was predictable and forced. A try hard edgelord masterpiece. Surprised he wasn't wearing a fedora. This movie just doesn't get the joke, because it IS the joke.", "Duh?Masterpiece? Are you Jokering me? Mediocre at best. The only explanation I can come up with to explain the gushing praise of this boring film is the dumbing down of a generation by the education system and PC culture. People seem to think its some kind of brilliant social commentary. I usually like Joaquin Phoenix, but here he plays a bland character who comes across as very dull and of low intelligence. His laugh is grating and very un-Joker like, his dialogue is stilted and uncomfortable. There is no wit, no clever dark comedy, just seriousness and depression. The Joker has always been portayed as crazy and mentally unbalanced, but never dim-witted, until now. I don't know why this character is even called the Joker. Other than having the name Arthur Fleck he seems to be an entirely different character. Its a depressing film, which is not a bad thing in and of itself, but in this case it is. Thankfully I didn't pay any money to see this one. I'm giving it one star to even out the ridiculously high rating its got. Otherwise I'd probably give it a 4", "Hype at its finest.Despite the third best performance of Joaquin Phoenix's career, even he can't keep the film interesting. I never believed the hype this film was getting and I was right. Fanboys dream but as true film goes, it's quite terrible. The difference between fan reviews and critic reviews says it all, and even the critics were being generous.", "Awful just awfulWhy in the hell would they make a movie like that... There are enough problems in the world", "Irresponsible Filmmaking at its FinestThis was irresponsible filmmaking at its finest coming at the worst possible time. Todd Phillips should be ashamed. He had the opportunity to offer a positive message to people that see themselves in Arthur's shoes- people that have been wronged by the system and see no way out- and instead he reassured them that they are monsters and the only way they can \"win\" is if they get back at the society that wronged them in any way they can. He's a cash grabber that used his platform to tell an entertaining Joker story, instead of a deeper resonate message like it could have been. From an outsider's view, one could argue that this scenario is what happens when society fails, but this was not told from an outsider's view. This was told from the terribly empathetic Arthur's view, and so I see no reason why a potential school shooter wouldn't relate to him. This is saying to that person, it's better to be infamous than a nobody. It's a very dangerous message at this current time. For those that argue, it's only art, I argue that the mainstream media is potentially the most powerful force in the entire world. Personally, I feel that with great power comes great responsibility. Media makers have the right to make whatever they want, but they have the responsibility to use the power they've been given for good and this was completely the opposite...Objective review: Beautifully shot and acted, but super boring at times.", "PointlessI judge a movie by how many times I needed to fast forward through it. Joker set a record for me. I spent $6 on Amazon to watch this dull and duller movie. It is painful to see how many people wrote positive reviews. Who are they? What did they see? What did I miss? Yeah, I get the comments on society, etc., but so what?", "LameThis movie was so boring, I kept falling asleep. I felt very awkward several times. My son & I kept looking at each other like should we just get up & leave? I probably should have. I cant believe some of the reviews on here. People have very crappy taste apparently.

I have nothing good to say about it at all. It was a poorly crated story awkwardly told. The only saving grace is that Joaquin Phoenix acted an awful character in an awful story. I couldn't wait for the movie to end. I found it to be incredibly obvious and predictable for every \"twist\" in the film. The end credits were the best part when I finally was free. I was on a date or I would have just walked out early on.", "Save your two hours and thank meI've read so many 1 star ratings of people who shares the same mood as I do. They have written so long points about the movie. This movie doesn't worth writing so long about it. Just trash.

Worst movie of the year, hands down.", "UnoriginalThere are so many movies out there about the mentally ill man that, if he had been given an ounce of respect and kindness, would not have gone on a killing rampage. Shutter island, Donnie Darko, and The Shining are just a few movies that are so much better than this one with the same exact plot but they weren't boring! The only redeeming factor of this movie was Joaquin Phoenix's outstanding performance.", "lose of both time and moneyThis was one of the worse movies I have seen. It was over acted by all actors, the story dragged on and on. I saw this movie for a bargain matinee and thought I was ripped off! The only good part was the comfy chairs and the half priced snacks! Phoenix was so over the top and not in a good way. PHOENIX STOP DANCING!!!

I hadn't read any reviews. I had no idea what the film was about.\n\nThe Positive: Joaquin Phoenix is an extraordinarily gifted actor and this piece of garbage screenplay was was a great vehicle to showcase his talent.\n\nThe Negative: Everything else. This movie is about whatever you want it to be about.

I was bored and found it lacking in anything of value. I have worked in mental health for many years and found this to be a poor choice of paths to take someone down. I found little empathy and even less point to this film. Joaquin Phoenix was brilliantly my score in no way reflects his acting he was simply awesome. If you liked Heath Ledger's portrayal then you will probably also enjoy this movie. This by itself and aside from the DC universe was a pretty good movie as a joker movie it was boring. I almost never give 1 star reviews but this one I could have not watched and been much happier.", "What a crap!!It makes me really feel upset when high score on such bad movie and I regret wasting 2 hours watching it.", "These 10/10 reviews are fakeThis movie is totally garbage. I kept falling asleep on it. It was so boring that I played solitaire, completed paid surveys, and did some online shopping while it was playing.", "Don't waste your timeComplete garbage.

Opportunity to take advantage of the incredible Joaquin Phoenix was blown.\n\nGratuitous violence. Misplaced violence. Wrong approach to joker.\n\nDisappointing connection to viewer.

I could have done million better things with the time that i wasted watching this movie. Utter waste of time. decided to watch after all the hype on social media. But movie deserves 0 stars.", "Mega boreI use IMBD ratings to decide which films to go to see at the cinema. When I saw that this film had a 9 rating I assumed that I was going to see an extremely good film. How wrong I was, the film was less than average. The film didn't get me emotionally involved in any way. I didn't feel sorry for the main character or any of the other characters that he murdered and none of the other characters in the film moved me in any way. It was a \"run of the mill\" film that I couldn't wait to end. The only good thing about it was that my 15 year old granddaughter enjoyed it.", "Pseudo art for theatrical wannabesThat is one of the most aimless, predictable and shallow films I've seen. The only thing that made any sense was that it was somehow connected to the Batman universe. Joaquin's ability to portray a psychopath, although pointless, was ultimately decimated by the fact this was a Batman film. I can't really take it seriously because of that. There is no real social drama, it has no message and is full of fallacies. It doesn't raise any awareness. Dialogs when present were pathetic. All in all the Joker is neither a real film based on true events nor a fiction. It tries really hard to do both and it fails spectacularly.", "CrapThis movie rips off other movies, doesn't have any redeeming value, and even implies Bruce Wayne is the father of the Joker? What kind of joke is this? Not a DC movie, not an origins story. Just the work of some hack who stole ideas from Scorsese, and tries to make a dangerous, ill man into some kind of folk hero. Unfortunately Joaquim Phoenix just overacts in this one. And he's in literally every single scene in this movie, so it becomes very tiresome to watch. Crap.", "A MASTERPIECEJoaquin Phoenix's performance is different. He is over acting some times. Phoenix is not being true to the character. He is what he is because what he experienced. The childhood trauma and the time he spend in the asylum. If He is out in the society because he is fit to do so. The seven medication doesn't seem to have a bit of effect on him.\n\nAfter the metro incident he is breaking a chain to free himself from what the society need him to be. There is no change in his ways. The character didn't evolve. He is same at the beginning and at the end.\n\nSeventy percent of the film's screen time is dedicated to Arthur Fleck. All the other characters are ill written, only to support him. They all lack a soul. Even Robert deniero disappoints us. He lost his aura somewhere in the nineties. The film is spoon feeding us. The viewers are not idiots we know what realism is. The scene where he realizes the character Sophie is his figment of imagination is an utter failure. Apology to Andrei tarskovski. And the scene he is showing fatherly affection towards Murray is like a worst of the worst psycho moment. After the incident of metro killings, the plot loses its grip. I clearly couldn't define what happening and why. The script hides in the smoke of violence. That is too disturbing to watch. And I forget to mention the letter. A Pathetic turn of the film. The film 'saw' is better than this. I hate the communist tone used in the film. By showing us a glimpse of modern times, Todd Phillips making a point. The joker is saying he is not political. It is kind of a doublespeak. In fact the film is a doublespeak. Creating chaos without the intention of creating one. The poor class killing the rich for the societies inequality.\n\nWhat I loved in the Christopher Nolan's joker is his philosophy. He is an agent of chaos. He like to watch the world burn. While the Batman is an agent of order. He may be a clown but he is deep inside. The Nolan's joker can make an elaborate plan and execute it efficiently. But Philp's joker is mere a delusional shallow clown. I ask myself, Why the movie is called 'Joker'. Remove the names of Wayne family and give them another names. Replace Gotham by Manhattan. The result will not be a DC joker instead it will give us a psycho clown movie. Todd Philips used an icon for his own gain.\n\nA predictable ending. Giving the society a false message.for what? The film is not worth it. Yes, it is a masterpiece. Whisper it a trillion times, may be it will became one.", "Is that a joke?Still heath ledger best joker ever this movie sucks", "Bored the hell out of me!A long drawn out film.

I'm sitting in the theater feeling extremely uncomfortable and my mind is wandering to all of the young, white, disturbed men that have senselessly murdered people in our country.

I simply hated this movie since the very first minute. Maybe i have no sensibility at all to feel any empathy with this joker.

It is complete crap. I really don't understand the hype over it. I was watching it and just couldn't watch it till the end.. it was so boring. I made myself go and watch it again till the end, but again there was no way for me to do that. It was extremely boring, made no sense, zero connection to Joker. When I saw people writing that Joaquin is better joker than Heath Ledger I just needed to see that.

I guess some kind of advertising agency may played role to make this movie hit and few people who thinks themselves they are more intellectual (really may not) follow it.

Outside of the amazing lead acting, this movie's only suprise was that a known antagonist was the main character. The script was lackadaisical. The events were over dramatized and intangible. As a person who's suffered from mental illness myself, this movie did not portray a mentally ill person. It exponentially exaggerated what goes on with in the mind of the victim. Those who enjoy this portrayal are likely the non victims. As for how the comic book character was written: this story did adapt the idea that the joker knows he's a villain and enjoys it. At the end Arthur is still just a guy going to extremes to be accepted by society, instead being the joker who reshapes/exposes society to be something he thrives in.", "BORING AND OVERRATEDHow is this boring \"movie\" get so many 10 is beyond me", "Worst movie I have ever seenI feel like the only person who thought this movie was absolutely terrible and a complete waste of time and money.\n\nFirstly it's in no way entertaining. Every scene is an endless indulgence of people trying to be artsy but only accomplishing a boring, frustrating and pointless video of an actor being totally mental. Being completely mental is not hard to script or act, nothing needs to make sense and you don't need any element of normality - enter the joker. Acting on the spectrum is much more difficult - think Forrest Gump, I am Sam or Rain Man.\n\nSo if it's not meant to be entertaining than what's the point? Just to make you uncomfortable and frustrated? Job done. But who wants to watch that? No thanks.\n\nAs far as being the joker that's the most disappointing aspect of the film. The character has 0 intelligence, manipulative inclinations or ability to scheme and organise (again he's completely insane). He's also not funny. The joker from the comics is the antithesis of batman. He has no back story, he's clever and cunning and always putting things together. He runs a criminal empire and never acts alone. This joker was a loner, totally insane and gets in a fridge? Also he's far too old to be the joker, when Bruce grows up he'll be fighting an old man. So if it's not a joker origin story then what is it? A poorly scripted, weak story with an agenda to showcase an unrealistic perspective on mental illness.\n\nThe story moves along at a snail's pace to make allowances for the joker to dance around looking like a fruit cake.

At first glance, it appears that they are genuinely praising the movie's artistic quality but the truth is, they are merely praising its supposed profound social commentary and propaganda.\n\nIn a society where people prefer to stay in echo-chambers and repulsing those who don't fit the status quo, it is no surprise that this motion picture is highly acclaimed given that it appeals to the ideologies of Marxist lunatics today by making the audience feel sympathy for the poor characters and contempt for the wealthy ones.\n\nThe movie doesn't necessarily condone the main characters' actions as it still portrays their crimes in a negative light. But that leads us to another issue; the movie wants us to think that their crimes are the results of \"genius\" planning even though their plans are only made possible because of some stupid plot point that requires us to suspend our disbelief. It just goes to show how much the film is trying to insult the audience's intelligence by thinking they'd buy into it.\n\nIn summary, the director Bong Joon-Ho seems to believe that class and status indicate one's character, as evident by his attempt at portraying the main characters in a positive light despite them being a bunch of lazy and conniving criminals. Perhaps, the only redeemable quality of this film is its cinematography which admittedly is quite beautiful.", "Too UnpleasantThe plot is very good, with loads of twists and turns. However, I did not like this movie. It was an entirely unpleasant experience.", "Very disappointing movieThe movie won an Oscar, so I went to watch it with interest. But I was very disappointed! The actor's performance is good, but many of the plots of the movie are too rigid to make people seem stupid. Many people say metaphors, but I think that's a stereotype of class. The film portrays the poor as unscrupulous, and the rich are stupid. The director may express something worth thinking about, but the carrier of expression, that is, the plot of the film is stiff and failed. I'm puzzled that this film won an Oscar.", "Took about 11 tries to finish it.People kept recommending it so finally I pushed through to the end and what a drag it was. It seriously too about 11 tries to finish it. Slow, boring, unlikeable characters, disqusting. It had good photo so 2 stars.\n\nTrain to Busan is a different genre (or rather it has a genre) and is a much better Korean movie. This was just boring.", "One of the worst movies of the year, the real horror is that it got so many good reviewsThis movie is horrible on so many levels, its remarkable: The story/script feels like something a committee of teenage boys constructed during one drunken night, and the execution is mediocre at best (thanks to few OK actors) but overall painfully cheesy. But the true horror is, that this movie received so many awards and highly positive reviews. It makes me question the sanity and taste of humanity in 2019. If that outcome was the intention of the director, then he is a true meta-genius. In summary, skip this movie under all circumstances - its a true waste of your precious life time.", "How has this got such high scores and reviews?I don't understand how this did so well as the movie is really substandard compared to other movies that come from this region. The way it's scored across all sites I thought it was going to be as good if not better than Oldboy. The reviews kept saying stick with it and there's a mad twist at the end. So I stuck with it even though it bored me half way through and the twist at the end was so underwhelming I was a little bit angry and wasted my time. This scored a strong \"Meh\" with me. Dont waste your time", "OverratedIf you watch this movie you will probably like it or love it. Why? Because you are supposed to love it.\n\nIt's not a great movie. It's not even a good movie.\n\nIt is completely implausible, slow moving and has very little story.\n\nBut you will like it. Everyone already told you to like it.", "Very disappointedThe film won the Oscar for the first time in the history of Korean films. I wondered where it was better than other Korean movies, so I went to see it. To be honest, I'm disappointed. The film is too stereotypical and many plots are stiff. There's a lot better than this movie, and I can' t understand it won the Oscar.", "It won best film oscar.....How? How did it do that? Oh yeah because the oscars have been rigged for years that's how.\n\nBad acting and a bad script with too many plot holes and chunks of total boredom.\n\nIf you liked it then good for you. If you're pretending to like it just to seem like you \"get it\" then you are only lying to yourself.", "Poor acting//overated filmThis film has interesting scenes & cinematic direction but the suspense fell flat for me. Going into this film I thought it would be amazing because of all the reviews but I couldn't cling to the concepts. This movie is in no way a masterpiece.", "Everyone is awfulThe idea that the Kim family are underdogs simply because they're poor is what makes this movie unenjoyable. I like dark comedies as much as the next guy, and I like watching well-deserving people get their just desserts. But every single character in this film, minus the Park kids, are just so awful - to each other, to others, to themselves - that I never felt any sympathy to the Kims and instead just sighed my way through the movie thinking, \"oh my god, of course this is where this is going because what else could possibly happen.\"", "What's the hype?I don't understand the hype surrounding this movie. First, similar subjects have been covered many times before, e.g. \"Shattered glass\", \"Catch me if you can\", \"Bling ring\". Second, this film isn't particularly educational or anywhere near a real event. Third, this film doesn't even stand out among Korean films, the acting, cinematography, scripts are good but not great. I'm sure most people would have no recollection of this film in a few years because it's a movie about ... nothing.", "Dont Beleive The HypeThe first half of the movie is very good and then the movies takes a Cohe Brothersesque turn to the absurd. As with the Cohns Adaptation and some others (and I'm a major fan of the CB), when the writers ran into the brick wall not knowing where the story should go, they turned to the absurd and contrived the rest to the intelligent consumers utter disappointment. This movie will not last the test of time and its user rating will fade lower in time. Worth the watch just to learn how to finish a screenplay thats amazing but has yet for formulate a working ending... Just contrive the absurd and youll win an academy award.", "This movie took years off my lifeI have no idea how this got any good reviews. It was confusing and boring. Not for me.", "What a wasteA waste of time, of energy and of the stuff that award trinkets are made of. Why this shallow so-called satire has received accolades around the globe is far beyond me, but there you go: it's the emperor's clothes all over.", "I dont understand why...Ok .. everyine give high rating but i said this is a bad movie.. the acting is good.. but the movie is not..", "This is Decidedly NOT a Best PictureBest foreign film -- I can't say. But best picture overall? No way. It's excruciatingly slow and the story has been done before. It's not particularly funny either (like that other Korean film from a year ago was).\n\nI never connected with any of the characters or cared one bit about anyone.\n\nJust another example of identity politics and Hollywood giving undeserved awards.\n\nHow did Joker get overlooked?", "It's not as good as the ratings make it out to beIt has good start which quickly wraps you in and you get curious all along but once they're set in the plot, the movie dies down quickly until the 'last event'. The last event wasn't too disastrous except Mr. Kim's action. The naivety was tremendous from the housewife and tries too hard to sell. For the acting, it was top notch from everyone involved. The film is decent but don't go in with too much expectations as it's now nominated for oscars as well.", "It's not what i expected it to be.By it, i mean Oscar worthy.\n\nLike some of the rest here, i did not get it. With so much discussed about metaphors and the likes, I am either not good enough to read it or too casual not to over-read/read into somethings that's not there in the first place.\n\nThe movie tries too hard to be clever and it unfortunately ends up alienating people like me who come in hoping it may draw you in like the Shawshank redemption does.\n\nMy humble view notwithstanding, my congratulations to the Director for his Oscar win. It's a fabulous nod to Asian Cinema. It doesn't hurt that a ton of people here enjoy it too. That's the beauty of films, some like it some don't.", "Poor is the new great (it seems)I watched Parasite with an open mind. I deliberately avoided reviews (far too many fake ones out there) and even the trailer. After sitting through it, a film that in all honesty made two hours seem like three, then coming onto IMDB to see what others thought, I'm astonished. Let's begin with the positives though - cinematography was good, acting was okay(ish)... and that's about where it ends. The negatives are considerable though: A weak script which often made little sense or logic, more plot holes than Swiss cheese, ridiculous scenarios that defied belief and an ending that completely falls off a cliff edge and leaves the viewer wondering why they wasted two hours on this drivel. In reality I'd probably rate it a 4/10, but as at time of writing Parasite sits at 8.5/10, which is farcical given how weak this film is, I'm giving it a 2 to try and restore a bit of balance and common sense. I am gobsmacked at how many on here are rating this a 10 and can only presume that it's down to a complete lack of quality movie experience or, more likely, that some are so oversaturated in the endless stream of CGI comic book garbage we've all been subjected to over the last decade+ that anything, ANYTHING that strays from the rut immediately garners a flailing of arms and lauding of \"Best film EVER!!!\" Thirty years ago this film would've been where it deserved towards the low end of the barrel, but in today's distinctly subpar cinema offerings it's now being tipped as on Oscar possibilty. Utterly ridiculous. For those of you who are praising this film as the best thing since sliced bread, go and get yourselves a film education. A good place to start is Claude Berri's marvelous 'Jean de Florette' and 'Manon des Sources' to see how it should be done. Films you actually don't want to end, rather than praying for them to finish one hour in.", "A major disappointment of a movie2/10 for this, this movie was extremely slow not engaging and tediously boring, if you want to catchup on some sleep this will work? This movie is one to watch. It seems the Oscar win for best picture was a diversity quota gift. I wouldn't bother with this movie\n\nI saw 1917 when comparing it to this it was the deserving winner, but Hollywood is full of politics. This is the reason why ordinary people are losing interest in Hollywood and turning to streaming platforms in droves.", "Huh?At a loss to figure out why this film 1) won best picture of the year US Oscars 2) Cannes Palme d'Or. Also at a loss to understand why film categorized as a comedy.\n\nThere are moments of humor, but they are few and far between. The violence is also unwelcome.\n\nOn the Oscars award: \"Joker\" is a much stronger candidate. At least the audience has been advised of the violence in advance.\n\nSave yourself time, and possibly money. Skip it", "Not a Fun Watch, Not Interesting, Not QualityParasite is a shockingly overrated film that provides no likeable characters for the audience to root for. If anything, the most likeable people are the wealthy family being taken advantage of. This can be forgiven, movies with bad people as leads can still be good but Parasite is a depressing and often ridiculous ride. There are completely unrealistic twists and turns and the final bloody actions of the main character seem unwarranted and mildly out of character. I left the theater feeling like I had not only wasted time but was put in a bad mood from the overly bleak nature of the film. I know I am in the vast minority here, as every other person I have talked to loved the movie, but to me Parasite was not just unworthy of a Best Picture award but was an terrible movie.", "Well filmed but trivial storyFirstly, two warnings: 1. No real spoilers below. 2. My wife and I did not like this film at all (but note we also hated Pulp Fiction and Little Miss Sunshine which were also very popular with many people).\n\nThe cinematography was excellent. Beautifully filmed and showing bits of Sth Korean life that I had never seen. Of course, some aspects, the unemployed family and the wealthy family themselves were probably atypical.\n\nWe both thought the story and most scenes were quite \"old style\": trite, contrived and quite trivial. The film didn't venture into slapstick thank goodness but the lines and jokes were simple old ones transposed into a modern setting. I chuckled slightly ONCE during the film. Just not my sort of humour (give me \"Kives Out\"). In terms of drama it was a bit like watching grass grow, OK interesting grass but that was all.\n\nThe ending had a strong message but was executed in a completely over the top and ridiculous manner, and out of all context (style-wise) with what preceded.\n\nI can understand why a lot of people loved this film, and laughed a lot (although noone else was laughing in the cinema when we viewed the film). It has some strong elements in it but just dragged out too thinly for me.\n\nWorth seeing this film just in case it is your thing.", "Not as good as people saidAfter the first half this movie went completely down hills. Over and over I kept thinking \"was this scene necessary, What's the point?\" right up till the end. Don't wait for a huge plot twist at the end either, this is not freakin' Sixth sense! And, I dig gory, and thrillers, but this movie is just a no for me.", "No thanksDecent acting, not great. Not suspenseful. Not thrilling. Not scary, not even a bit. Decent overall message.

The high ratings are suspicious and puzzling.", "Kari On KoreaHow in God's name this got an Oscar is beyond me. Starts very well as a concept and even holds ones attention for the first hour.

It didn't.", "Terrible excuse for the best picture oscar!Saw this movie today. While well acted and photographed, the story was nothing exceptional. Interesting for a while, yet waiting for something better to happen which never occurred.

OK, the plot was interesting, the actors were good, but when ALL of the characters are unpleasant and most of them are a bunch of lazy, nasty parasites I can't have any positive feelings.

Here, I saw an example of a mental cesspool.\n\n1917 was my choice.", "Run fast from this movie!Every single minute of this movie I was wondering why, why, why, would anyone give any credit to such rubbish. How a terrible movie like this would get any praise at all! And I finally got the answer: Political Bleeping Correctness. \"Give an award to the different people even if the movie stinks\"!

I really did.This movie was well written, well acted, and the theme (the have's & have not's, & what they do for personal gain and how to keep it) was, indeed, vividly executed.

How this trash won the Oscar when there were so many good nominations that year is a mystery.", "plotting, scamming, farceThis is a black comedy with peculiarly oriental sense of humour. It involves plotting, scamming, farce, and a series of increasingly bizarre events that eventually spin out of all control, with a macabre twist.\n\nIf you laugh at people having accidents or enjoy the Japanese game shows where contestants have to eat large maggots or suffer cockroaches crawling all over their faces, then you'll probably enjoy the humour.\n\nIf you're not on that particular wavelength then you might struggle with some of it.

Hopes that were far too high, and far too unrealistic. What the hell is this story. And what's the point?\n\nParasite feels new, fresh, original.. all of the things that likely earned enough attention for so many so much acclaim. But where is it all going?\n\nIt's kind of an anti-hero tale. This family is pulling off a multi-layered, clever con on this gullible, innocent family. And as the main characters, you're kind of rooting for them. Or, at least interested and invested in their story and where it's going.\n\nThe concept is not my favorite, but it holds water as far as a plot goes. However just as you are wrapping up at 2:00, and wondering where this plane is going to land, the film takes a wild unexpected turn for the worst. And now you're wondering what kind of film you're watching. Is this thriller? Is this horror? Is this drama? Is this mystery? The plot twists along the way are catchy in their own right, but lacking heart, these genres don't quite all come together.\n\nThe fact that this film won Best Picture at the 2019 Oscars is baffling... beyond me.\n\nWhat little message there is to this film leaves you hopeless, questioning purpose and the future. Not the kind experience I'm hoping for at the cinema.", "Not that greatI really don't know what planet some of these reviewers came from but this is definitely not a fantastic movie.

It beautifully demonstrates the life in the city slums, with superbly executed plots to get the Parks' existing staff fired and replaced with the Kims. These plots become progressively more cruel, showing the Kims' slide into villainy.\n\nThe complication arrives when the former head maid asks the Kims if she can retrieve something from the Park house. Here the Kims truly become villains, manipulating the secrets of the house for their own gain and even turning to overt violence to preserve their position. It is here that the film loses its way.\n\nThough certainly the Kims and their rivals have difficult choices to make, they are depicted as being gratuitously cruel. Each faction needs to remove obstacles, of course; each faction shows no restraint, fine. But the film lingers on this wickedness for so long, the audience becomes estranged to all of them. We no longer care about ANY of these characters because they have all become monsters; we abandon watching their fight because we have better things to do with our lives.\n\nThe failure of this film (as with so many of the last few decades) is in the writing and editing. The sets are beautiful, the camerawork superb. But the film lingers on human suffering purely for the shock factor. The suffering of the Kims is sadly reality for those at the bottom of South Korean society, and desperation makes villains of us all, but this is not a documentary. This is meant to be entertainment, something people can enjoy. Angela's Ashes depicted similar levels of poverty yet still maintained the sympathy of the audience.", "Wastages for teenagerThis movie is only good for old & mature people .it not for young generation \ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\ude02 Waste of night for me"]
